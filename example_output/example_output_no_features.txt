11.txt	alice 's adventures in wonderland lewis carroll the millennium fulcrum edition 30 chapter i 
11.txt	down the rabbit hole alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book
11.txt	so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her
11.txt	there was nothing so very remarkable in that
11.txt	nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear !
11.txt	oh dear !
11.txt	i shall be late !
11.txt	
11.txt	when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural
11.txt	but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge
11.txt	in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again
11.txt	the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well
11.txt	either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next 
11.txt	first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything
11.txt	then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves
11.txt	here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs 
11.txt	she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed
11.txt	it was labelled orange marmalade
11.txt	well !
11.txt	
11.txt	thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs !
11.txt	how brave they 'll all think me at home !
11.txt	why i would n't say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house !
11.txt	
11.txt	which was very likely true 
11.txt	down down down 
11.txt	would the fall never come to an end !
11.txt	i wonder how many miles i 've fallen by this time ?
11.txt	
11.txt	she said aloud 
11.txt	i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth 
11.txt	let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think
11.txt	alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say 
11.txt	presently she began again 
11.txt	i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth !
11.txt	how funny it 'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward !
11.txt	for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes that 's about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i 've got to ?
11.txt	the antipathies i think
11.txt	please maam is this new zealand or australia ?
11.txt	
11.txt	and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as you 're falling through the air !
11.txt	do you think you could manage it ?
11.txt	and what an ignorant little girl she 'll think me for asking !
11.txt	no it 'll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere 
11.txt	down down down 
11.txt	there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again 
11.txt	dinah 'll miss me very much to night i should think !
11.txt	dinah was the cat 
11.txt	i hope they 'll remember her saucer of milk at tea time 
11.txt	dinah my dear !
11.txt	i wish you were down here with me !
11.txt	there are no mice in the air i 'm afraid but you might catch a bat and that 's very like a mouse you know 
11.txt	but do cats eat bats i wonder ?
11.txt	
11.txt	and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats ?
11.txt	do cats eat bats ?
11.txt	
11.txt	and sometimes do bats eat cats ?
11.txt	
11.txt	for you see as she could n't answer either question it did n't much matter which way she put it 
11.txt	she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat ?
11.txt	
11.txt	when suddenly thump !
11.txt	thump !
11.txt	down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over
11.txt	alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead
11.txt	before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it
11.txt	there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it 's getting !
11.txt	
11.txt	she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof
11.txt	there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked
11.txt	and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again
11.txt	suddenly she came upon a little three legged table all made of solid glass
11.txt	there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alice 's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall
11.txt	but alas !
11.txt	either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them 
11.txt	however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted !
11.txt	alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw 
11.txt	how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway
11.txt	and even if my head would go through
11.txt	oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope !
11.txt	i think i could if i only knew how to begin 
11.txt	for you see so many out of the way things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible
11.txt	there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it [ which certainly was not here before
11.txt	said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me
11.txt	it was all very well to say drink me
11.txt	but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry  no i 'll look first
11.txt	she said and see whether it 's marked
11.txt	poison
11.txt	or not
11.txt	for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long
11.txt	and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds
11.txt	and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison
11.txt	however this bottle was not marked poison
11.txt	what a curious feeling !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden 
11.txt	i must be shutting up like a telescope  first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this
11.txt	for it might end you know
11.txt	i wonder what i should be like then ?
11.txt	
11.txt	and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing
11.txt	after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once
11.txt	but alas for poor alice !
11.txt	when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery
11.txt	and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried
11.txt	come there 's no use in crying like that !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice to herself rather sharply
11.txt	she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes
11.txt	and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people
11.txt	but it 's no use now
11.txt	why there 's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person !
11.txt	soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me
11.txt	were beautifully marked in currants  well i 'll eat it
11.txt	she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way ?
11.txt	which way ?
11.txt	holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way
11.txt	so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake
11.txt	chapter ii 
11.txt	the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser !
11.txt	
11.txt	cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english
11.txt	now i 'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was !
11.txt	good bye feet !
11.txt	for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off 
11.txt	oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears ?
11.txt	i 'm sure i sha n't be able !
11.txt	i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can
11.txt	but i must be kind to them
11.txt	let me see i 'll give them a new pair of boots every christmas 
11.txt	and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it 
11.txt	thought alice or perhaps they wo n't walk the way i want to go ! they must go by the carrier
11.txt	and how odd the directions will look !
11.txt	alice 's right foot esq
11.txt	hearthrug near the fender with alice 's love
11.txt	oh dear what nonsense i 'm talking !
11.txt	just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door
11.txt	poor alice !
11.txt	it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye
11.txt	but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again
11.txt	you ought to be ashamed of yourself
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	a great girl like you
11.txt	stop this moment i tell you !
11.txt	
11.txt	but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall
11.txt	after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming 
11.txt	it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh !
11.txt	the duchess the duchess !
11.txt	oh !
11.txt	wo n't she be savage if i 've kept her waiting !
11.txt	
11.txt	alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one
11.txt	so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir
11.txt	alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear !
11.txt	how queer everything is to day !
11.txt	and yesterday things went on just as usual
11.txt	i wonder if i 've been changed in the night ?
11.txt	let me think was i the same when i got up this morning ?
11.txt	i almost think i can remember feeling a little different 
11.txt	but if i 'm not the same the next question is who in the world am i ?
11.txt	ah that 's the great puzzle !
11.txt	
11.txt	and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them
11.txt	i 'm sure i 'm not ada
11.txt	she knows such a very little !
11.txt	besides she 's she and i 'm i and oh dear how puzzling it all is !
11.txt	i 'll try if i know all the things i used to know 
11.txt	let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear !
11.txt	i shall never get to twenty at that rate !
11.txt	however the multiplication table does n't signify let 's try geography
11.txt	london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and rome no that 's all wrong i 'm certain !
11.txt	i must have been changed for mabel !
11.txt	i 'll try and say
11.txt	how doth the little
11.txt	how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws !
11.txt	i 'm sure those are not the right words
11.txt	said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on
11.txt	ever so many lessons to learn !
11.txt	no i 've made up my mind about it
11.txt	if i 'm mabel i 'll stay down here !
11.txt	i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ! it 'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying
11.txt	come up again dear !
11.txt	i shall only look up and say
11.txt	who am i then ? tell me that first and then if i like being that person i 'll come up if not i 'll stay down here till i 'm somebody else
11.txt	but oh dear !
11.txt	cried alice with a sudden burst of tears
11.txt	i am so very tired of being all alone here !
11.txt	as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit 's little white kid gloves while she was talking 
11.txt	how can i have done that ?
11.txt	
11.txt	she thought 
11.txt	i must be growing small again
11.txt	
11.txt	she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether
11.txt	that was a narrow escape !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence
11.txt	and now for the garden !
11.txt	
11.txt	and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas !
11.txt	the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever
11.txt	and i declare it 's too bad that it is !
11.txt	as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash !
11.txt	she was up to her chin in salt water 
11.txt	her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway
11.txt	alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station 
11.txt	however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high
11.txt	i wish i had n't cried so much !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out 
11.txt	i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears !
11.txt	that will be a queer thing to be sure !
11.txt	however everything is queer to day 
11.txt	just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself
11.txt	would it be of any use now
11.txt	everything is so out of the way down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate there 's no harm in trying
11.txt	
11.txt	so she began
11.txt	i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse !
11.txt	
11.txt	o mouse do you know the way out of this pool ? alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brother 's latin grammar
11.txt	the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing
11.txt	perhaps it does n't understand english
11.txt	thought alice
11.txt	for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened 
11.txt	so she began again ou est ma chatte ?
11.txt	
11.txt	which was the first sentence in her french lesson book 
11.txt	the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright
11.txt	oh i beg your pardon !
11.txt	
11.txt	cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal 's feelings 
11.txt	i quite forgot you did n't like cats 
11.txt	not like cats !
11.txt	
11.txt	cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice 
11.txt	would you like cats if you were me ?
11.txt	well perhaps not
11.txt	and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you 'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her 
11.txt	said alice in a soothing tone do n't be angry about it  she is such a dear quiet thing
11.txt	cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended 
11.txt	we wo n't talk about her any more if you 'd rather not 
11.txt	we indeed !
11.txt	
11.txt	cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail 
11.txt	as if i would talk on such a subject !
11.txt	our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things !
11.txt	do n't let me hear the name again !
11.txt	alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and she 's such a capital one for catching mice oh i beg your pardon !
11.txt	said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation 
11.txt	are you are you fond of of dogs ?
11.txt	
11.txt	the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you !
11.txt	a little bright eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair !
11.txt	and it 'll fetch things when you throw them and it 'll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things i ca n't remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says it 's so useful it 's worth a hundred pounds !
11.txt	he says it kills all the rats and oh dear !
11.txt	
11.txt	i wo n't indeed !
11.txt	cried alice in a sorrowful tone
11.txt	for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went
11.txt	so she called softly after it mouse dear !
11.txt	do come back again and we wo n't talk about cats or dogs either if you do n't like them !
11.txt	
11.txt	when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i 'll tell you my history and you 'll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs 
11.txt	it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures 
11.txt	alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore
11.txt	chapter iii 
11.txt	a caucus race and a long tale they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable
11.txt	the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life 
11.txt	indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say
11.txt	i am older than you and must know better
11.txt	at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me !
11.txt	i 'll soon make you dry enough !
11.txt	
11.txt	they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle 
11.txt	alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon
11.txt	ahem !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the mouse with an important air are you all ready ?
11.txt	this is the driest thing i know 
11.txt	silence all round if you please !
11.txt	william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest  edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria
11.txt	said the lory with a shiver
11.txt	i beg your pardon !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the mouse frowning but very politely did you speak ?
11.txt	not i !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the lory hastily
11.txt	i thought you did
11.txt	i proceed 
11.txt	said the mouse
11.txt	edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable
11.txt	said the duck
11.txt	found it
11.txt	the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what
11.txt	it
11.txt	means 
11.txt	i know what
11.txt	it
11.txt	means well enough when i find a thing
11.txt	the question is what did the archbishop find ?
11.txt	said the duck it 's generally a frog or a worm  the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on
11.txt	william 's conduct at first was moderate 
11.txt	found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown  but the insolence of his normans
11.txt	it continued turning to alice as it spoke
11.txt	as wet as ever
11.txt	said alice in a melancholy tone it does n't seem to dry me at all  in that case
11.txt	said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet
11.txt	i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies
11.txt	said the eaglet 
11.txt	i do n't know the meaning of half those long words and what 's more i do n't believe you do either !
11.txt	
11.txt	and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly
11.txt	what i was going to say
11.txt	what is a caucus race ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	not that she wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything
11.txt	why
11.txt	and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the dodo managed it 
11.txt	said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it
11.txt	first it marked out a race course in a sort of circle [ the exact shape does n't matter
11.txt	it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there  there was no one two three and away
11.txt	however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over !
11.txt	
11.txt	and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won ?
11.txt	this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence 
11.txt	at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes 
11.txt	but who is to give the prizes ?
11.txt	
11.txt	quite a chorus of voices asked
11.txt	why she of course
11.txt	prizes !
11.txt	alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes 
11.txt	there was exactly one a piece all round
11.txt	but she must have a prize herself you know
11.txt	of course
11.txt	what else have you got in your pocket ?
11.txt	
11.txt	he went on turning to alice
11.txt	only a thimble
11.txt	hand it over here
11.txt	then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble
11.txt	alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh
11.txt	and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could
11.txt	the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back
11.txt	however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more
11.txt	you promised to tell me your history you know
11.txt	said alice and why it is you hate c and d
11.txt	mine is a long and a sad tale !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the mouse turning to alice and sighing
11.txt	it is a long tail certainly
11.txt	said alice looking down with wonder at the mouse 's tail
11.txt	but why do you call it sad ?
11.txt	and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a mouse that he met in the house
11.txt	let us both go to law i will prosecute you
11.txt	come i 'll take no denial
11.txt	we must have a trial for really this morning i 've nothing to do 
11.txt	said the mouse to the cur
11.txt	such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath 
11.txt	i 'll be judge i 'll be jury
11.txt	said cunning old fury
11.txt	i 'll try the whole cause and condemn you to death 
11.txt	said the mouse to alice severely 
11.txt	what are you thinking of ?
11.txt	you are not attending !
11.txt	i beg your pardon
11.txt	said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think ?
11.txt	cried the mouse sharply and very angrily
11.txt	a knot !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her 
11.txt	oh do let me help to undo it !
11.txt	i shall do nothing of the sort
11.txt	you insult me by talking such nonsense !
11.txt	said the mouse getting up and walking away 
11.txt	pleaded poor alice 
11.txt	but you 're so easily offended you know !
11.txt	the mouse only growled in reply
11.txt	please come back and finish your story !
11.txt	
11.txt	alice called after it
11.txt	and the others all joined in chorus yes please do !
11.txt	
11.txt	but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker
11.txt	what a pity it would n't stay !
11.txt	
11.txt	sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight
11.txt	and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear !
11.txt	let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper !
11.txt	
11.txt	hold your tongue ma !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the young crab a little snappishly 
11.txt	you 're enough to try the patience of an oyster !
11.txt	said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular 
11.txt	she 'd soon fetch it back !
11.txt	and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the lory
11.txt	alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinah 's our cat 
11.txt	and she 's such a capital one for catching mice you ca n't think !
11.txt	and oh i wish you could see her after the birds !
11.txt	why she 'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it !
11.txt	this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party 
11.txt	some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking
11.txt	and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears !
11.txt	it 's high time you were all in bed !
11.txt	on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone
11.txt	i wish i had n't mentioned dinah !
11.txt	
11.txt	she said to herself in a melancholy tone 
11.txt	nobody seems to like her down here and i 'm sure she 's the best cat in the world !
11.txt	oh my dear dinah !
11.txt	i wonder if i shall ever see you any more !
11.txt	
11.txt	and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited 
11.txt	in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story
11.txt	chapter iv 
11.txt	the rabbit sends in a little bill it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something
11.txt	and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess !
11.txt	the duchess !
11.txt	oh my dear paws !
11.txt	oh my fur and whiskers !
11.txt	she 'll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets !
11.txt	where can i have dropped them i wonder ?
11.txt	
11.txt	alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely
11.txt	very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here ?
11.txt	run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan !
11.txt	quick now !
11.txt	
11.txt	and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made
11.txt	he took me for his housemaid
11.txt	how surprised he 'll be when he finds out who i am !
11.txt	but i 'd better take him his fan and gloves that is if i can find them
11.txt	
11.txt	she said to herself as she ran  as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name
11.txt	w  rabbit
11.txt	she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves
11.txt	how queer it seems
11.txt	i suppose dinah 'll be sending me on messages next !
11.txt	
11.txt	alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit ! and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen
11.txt	miss alice ! come here directly and get ready for your walk !
11.txt	coming in a minute nurse ! but i 've got to see that the mouse does n't get out
11.txt	only i do n't think
11.txt	by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass 
11.txt	alice went on that they 'd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that ! there was no label this time with the words drink me
11.txt	but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips  i know something interesting is sure to happen
11.txt	i do hope it 'll make me grow large again for really i 'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing !
11.txt	it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken 
11.txt	she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything
11.txt	so i 'll just see what this bottle does  she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself that 's quite enough i hope i sha n't grow any more as it is i ca n't get out at the door i do wish i had n't drunk quite so much !
11.txt	it was too late to wish that !
11.txt	she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head
11.txt	still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens 
11.txt	what will become of me ?
11.txt	luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy
11.txt	it was much pleasanter at home
11.txt	i almost wish i had n't gone down that rabbit hole and yet and yet it 's rather curious you know this sort of life !
11.txt	i do wonder what can have happened to me !
11.txt	when i used to read fairy tales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one !
11.txt	there ought to be a book written about me that there ought !
11.txt	and when i grow up i 'll write one but i 'm grown up now
11.txt	she added in a sorrowful tone
11.txt	at least there 's no room to grow up any more here  but then
11.txt	that 'll be a comfort one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn !
11.txt	oh i should n't like that !
11.txt	oh you foolish alice !
11.txt	
11.txt	she answered herself 
11.txt	how can you learn lessons in here ?
11.txt	why there 's hardly room for you and no room at all for any lesson books !
11.txt	and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether
11.txt	but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen
11.txt	mary ann !
11.txt	mary ann !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the voice 
11.txt	fetch me my gloves this moment !
11.txt	then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs 
11.txt	alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it
11.txt	presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it
11.txt	but as the door opened inwards and alice 's elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure 
11.txt	alice heard it say to itself then i 'll go round and get in at the window 
11.txt	that you wo n't
11.txt	she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame or something of the sort
11.txt	next came an angry voice the rabbitspat !
11.txt	pat !
11.txt	where are you ?
11.txt	
11.txt	and then a voice she had never heard before sure then i 'm here !
11.txt	digging for apples yer honour !
11.txt	digging for apples indeed !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the rabbit angrily 
11.txt	here !
11.txt	come and help me out of this !
11.txt	
11.txt	sounds of more broken glass 
11.txt	now tell me pat what 's that in the window ?
11.txt	sure it 's an arm yer honour !
11.txt	
11.txt	he pronounced it arrum 
11.txt	an arm you goose !
11.txt	who ever saw one that size ?
11.txt	why it fills the whole window !
11.txt	sure it does yer honour but it 's an arm for all that 
11.txt	well it 's got no business there at any rate go and take it away !
11.txt	there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then
11.txt	such as sure i do n't like it yer honour at all at all !
11.txt	
11.txt	do as i tell you you coward !
11.txt	
11.txt	and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air 
11.txt	this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass 
11.txt	what a number of cucumber frames there must be !
11.txt	
11.txt	thought alice 
11.txt	i wonder what they 'll do next !
11.txt	as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could !
11.txt	i 'm sure i do n't want to stay in here any longer !
11.txt	she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words where 's the other ladder ?
11.txt	why i had n't to bring but one
11.txt	bill 's got the other bill !
11.txt	fetch it here lad !
11.txt	here put em up at this corner no tie em together first they do n't reach half high enough yet oh !
11.txt	they 'll do well enough
11.txt	do n't be particular here bill !
11.txt	catch hold of this rope will the roof bear ?
11.txt	mind that loose slate oh it 's coming down !
11.txt	heads below !
11.txt	
11.txt	a loud crash now who did that ?
11.txt	it was bill i fancy who 's to go down the chimney ?
11.txt	nay i sha n't !
11.txt	you do it !
11.txt	that i wo n't then !
11.txt	bill 's to go down here bill !
11.txt	the master says you 're to go down the chimney !
11.txt	so bill 's got to come down the chimney has he ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice to herself 
11.txt	shy they seem to put everything upon bill !
11.txt	i would n't be in bill 's place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure
11.txt	but i think i can kick a little !
11.txt	oh ! she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she could n't guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill
11.txt	the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill !
11.txt	then the rabbit 's voice alongcatch him you by the hedge !
11.txt	
11.txt	then silence and then another confusion of voiceshold up his head brandy now do n't choke him how was it old fellow ?
11.txt	what happened to you ?
11.txt	tell us all about it !
11.txt	last came a little feeble squeaking voice [ that 's bill
11.txt	so you did old fellow !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the others
11.txt	we must burn the house down !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the rabbit 's voice
11.txt	and alice called out as loud as she could if you do 
11.txt	i 'll set dinah at you !
11.txt	there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself
11.txt	if they had any sense they 'd take the roof off
11.txt	
11.txt	i wonder what they will do next ! after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say
11.txt	a barrowful will do to begin with 
11.txt	thought alice
11.txt	but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face 
11.txt	a barrowful of what ?
11.txt	i 'll put a stop to this
11.txt	which produced another dead silence
11.txt	alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head 
11.txt	if i eat one of these cakes
11.txt	so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly 
11.txt	as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside 
11.txt	the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea pigs who were giving it something out of a bottle 
11.txt	they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared
11.txt	but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood
11.txt	the first thing i 've got to do
11.txt	i think that will be the best plan 
11.txt	it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged
11.txt	the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it
11.txt	and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry
11.txt	an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her 
11.txt	poor little thing !
11.txt	said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it
11.txt	but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing
11.txt	hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy
11.txt	whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it
11.txt	then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over
11.txt	and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it
11.txt	then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again
11.txt	then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut
11.txt	this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape
11.txt	so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy 's bark sounded quite faint in the distance
11.txt	and yet what a dear little puppy it was !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves
11.txt	oh dear !
11.txt	i 'd nearly forgotten that i 've got to grow up again !
11.txt	let me see how is it to be managed ?
11.txt	i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other
11.txt	but the great question is what ?
11.txt	the great question certainly was what ?
11.txt	alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances
11.txt	there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself
11.txt	and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it
11.txt	she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else
11.txt	chapter v advice from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice
11.txt	who are you ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the caterpillar
11.txt	this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation 
11.txt	alice replied rather shyly
11.txt	what do you mean by that ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the caterpillar sternly 
11.txt	explain yourself !
11.txt	i i hardly know sir just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then 
11.txt	i ca n't explain myself i 'm afraid sir
11.txt	said alice because i 'm not myself you see 
11.txt	i do n't see
11.txt	i 'm afraid i ca n't put it more clearly
11.txt	alice replied very politely for i ca n't understand it myself to begin with
11.txt	and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing  it is n't
11.txt	well perhaps you have n't found it so yet
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day you know and then after that into a butterfly i should think you 'll feel it a little queer wo n't you ? not a bit
11.txt	well perhaps your feelings may be different
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	all i know is it would feel very queer to me
11.txt	said the caterpillar contemptuously 
11.txt	who are you ?
11.txt	which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
11.txt	alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar 's making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely
11.txt	i think you ought to tell me who you are first
11.txt	said the caterpillar
11.txt	here was another puzzling question
11.txt	and as alice could not think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away
11.txt	come back !
11.txt	
11.txt	the caterpillar called after her 
11.txt	i 've something important to say !
11.txt	this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again
11.txt	keep your temper
11.txt	is that all ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could
11.txt	no
11.txt	alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing 
11.txt	for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think you 're changed do you ?
11.txt	i 'm afraid i am sir
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	ca n't remember what things ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the caterpillar
11.txt	well i 've tried to say
11.txt	how doth the little busy bee
11.txt	alice replied in a very melancholy voice
11.txt	repeat
11.txt	you are old father william
11.txt	alice folded her hands and began you are old father william
11.txt	the young man said and your hair has become very white
11.txt	and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is right ? in my youth
11.txt	father william replied to his son
11.txt	i feared it might injure the brain
11.txt	but now that i 'm perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again  you are old
11.txt	said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat
11.txt	yet you turned a back somersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that ? in my youth
11.txt	said the sage as he shook his grey locks
11.txt	i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment one shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple ? you are old
11.txt	said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet
11.txt	yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it ? in my youth
11.txt	said his father
11.txt	i took to the law and argued each case with my wife
11.txt	and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life  you are old
11.txt	said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever
11.txt	yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever ?
11.txt	i have answered three questions and that is enough
11.txt	do you think i can listen all day to such stuff ?
11.txt	be off or i 'll kick you down stairs !
11.txt	that is not said right
11.txt	not quite right i 'm afraid
11.txt	said alice timidly
11.txt	some of the words have got altered  it is wrong from beginning to end
11.txt	the caterpillar was the first to speak
11.txt	what size do you want to be ?
11.txt	
11.txt	it asked
11.txt	oh i 'm not particular as to size
11.txt	alice hastily replied
11.txt	only one does n't like changing so often you know 
11.txt	i do n't know
11.txt	alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper
11.txt	are you content now ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the caterpillar
11.txt	well i should like to be a little larger sir if you would n't mind
11.txt	it is a very good height indeed !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high
11.txt	but i 'm not used to it !
11.txt	
11.txt	pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone 
11.txt	and she thought of herself
11.txt	i wish the creatures would n't be so easily offended ! you 'll get used to it in time
11.txt	this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again 
11.txt	in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself 
11.txt	then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter 
11.txt	one side of what ?
11.txt	the other side of what ?
11.txt	
11.txt	thought alice to herself
11.txt	of the mushroom
11.txt	alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it
11.txt	and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question 
11.txt	however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
11.txt	and now which is which ?
11.txt	
11.txt	she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot !
11.txt	she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly
11.txt	so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit 
11.txt	her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth
11.txt	but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit
11.txt	come my head 's free at last !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her
11.txt	what can all that green stuff be ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice 
11.txt	and where have my shoulders got to ?
11.txt	and oh my poor hands how is it i ca n't see you ?
11.txt	she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves
11.txt	as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent 
11.txt	she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings
11.txt	serpent !
11.txt	
11.txt	screamed the pigeon
11.txt	i 'm not a serpent !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice indignantly 
11.txt	let me alone !
11.txt	serpent i say again !
11.txt	
11.txt	repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob
11.txt	i 've tried every way and nothing seems to suit them !
11.txt	i have n't the least idea what you 're talking about
11.txt	i 've tried the roots of trees and i 've tried banks and i 've tried hedges
11.txt	there 's no pleasing them !
11.txt	alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished
11.txt	as if it was n't trouble enough hatching the eggs
11.txt	why i have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks !
11.txt	said the pigeon
11.txt	but i must be on the look out for serpents night and day !
11.txt	i 'm very sorry you 've been annoyed
11.txt	and just as i 'd taken the highest tree in the wood
11.txt	ugh serpent !
11.txt	but i 'm not a serpent i tell you !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice 
11.txt	continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ! i 'm a i 'm a
11.txt	what are you ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the pigeon 
11.txt	i can see you 're trying to invent something !
11.txt	well !
11.txt	i i 'm a little girl
11.txt	a likely story indeed !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt 
11.txt	i 've seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that !
11.txt	no no !
11.txt	you 're a serpent
11.txt	and there 's no use denying it 
11.txt	i suppose you 'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg !
11.txt	i have tasted eggs certainly
11.txt	said alice who was a very truthful child
11.txt	but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know 
11.txt	i do n't believe it
11.txt	this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding you 're looking for eggs i know that well enough
11.txt	and what does it matter to me whether you 're a little girl or a serpent ?
11.txt	said the pigeon
11.txt	but if they do why then they 're a kind of serpent that 's all i can say  it matters a good deal to me
11.txt	well be off then !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest 
11.txt	alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it 
11.txt	after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height
11.txt	it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first
11.txt	but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual 
11.txt	come there 's half my plan done now !
11.txt	how puzzling all these changes are !
11.txt	i 'm never sure what i 'm going to be from one minute to another !
11.txt	however i 've got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder ?
11.txt	
11.txt	as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high 
11.txt	whoever lives there
11.txt	so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high
11.txt	chapter vi 
11.txt	pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles 
11.txt	it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog
11.txt	and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads 
11.txt	she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen
11.txt	the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess 
11.txt	an invitation from the queen to play croquet
11.txt	
11.txt	the frog footman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen 
11.txt	an invitation for the duchess to play croquet 
11.txt	then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together
11.txt	alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her
11.txt	and when she next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky
11.txt	alice went timidly up to the door and knocked
11.txt	there 's no sort of use in knocking
11.txt	first because i 'm on the same side of the door as you are
11.txt	secondly because they 're making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you
11.txt	
11.txt	and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces
11.txt	please then
11.txt	said alice how am i to get in ? there might be some sense in your knocking
11.txt	for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know 
11.txt	he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil 
11.txt	the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us  but perhaps he ca n't help it
11.txt	but at any rate he might answer questions
11.txt	how am i to get in ?
11.txt	
11.txt	she repeated aloud
11.txt	i shall sit here
11.txt	the footman remarked till tomorrow
11.txt	or next day maybe
11.txt	how am i to get in ?
11.txt	
11.txt	asked alice again in a louder tone
11.txt	are you to get in at all ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the footman 
11.txt	that 's the first question you know 
11.txt	it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so 
11.txt	it 's really dreadful
11.txt	it 's enough to drive one crazy !
11.txt	the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations 
11.txt	i shall sit here
11.txt	but what am i to do ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	anything you like
11.txt	oh there 's no use in talking to him
11.txt	and she opened the door and went in
11.txt	the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby
11.txt	the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup
11.txt	there 's certainly too much pepper in that soup !
11.txt	
11.txt	alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing
11.txt	there was certainly too much of it in the air 
11.txt	even the duchess sneezed occasionally
11.txt	and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment 's pause 
11.txt	the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear
11.txt	please would you tell me
11.txt	said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that ? it 's a cheshire cat
11.txt	pig !
11.txt	said the duchess and that 's why  she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped
11.txt	but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again
11.txt	i did n't know that cheshire cats always grinned
11.txt	in fact i did n't know that cats could grin  they all can
11.txt	said the duchess
11.txt	and most of em do 
11.txt	i do n't know of any that do
11.txt	you do n't know much
11.txt	alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation 
11.txt	while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came first
11.txt	then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes 
11.txt	the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her
11.txt	and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not
11.txt	oh please mind what you 're doing !
11.txt	
11.txt	cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror 
11.txt	oh there goes his precious nose
11.txt	if everybody minded their own business
11.txt	the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does  which would not be an advantage
11.txt	just think of what work it would make with the day and night !
11.txt	said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge  you see the earth takes twenty four hours to turn round on its axis
11.txt	talking of axes
11.txt	alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint
11.txt	but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twenty four hours i think
11.txt	or is it twelve ?
11.txt	said the duchess chop off her head ! i
11.txt	oh do n't bother me
11.txt	said the duchess
11.txt	and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases 
11.txt	chorus
11.txt	in which the cook and the baby joined wow !
11.txt	wow !
11.txt	wow !
11.txt	while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the words
11.txt	chorus
11.txt	wow !
11.txt	wow !
11.txt	wow !
11.txt	you may nurse it a bit if you like !
11.txt	
11.txt	the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke 
11.txt	here ! i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen
11.txt	the cook threw a frying pan after her as she went out but it just missed her
11.txt	alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a star fish
11.txt	the poor little thing was snorting like a steam engine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it
11.txt	as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air 
11.txt	if i do n't take this child away with me
11.txt	she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time
11.txt	do n't grunt
11.txt	the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it 
11.txt	there could be no doubt that it had a very turn up nose much more like a snout than a real nose
11.txt	also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all 
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	that 's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself  but perhaps it was only sobbing
11.txt	no there were no tears 
11.txt	if you 're going to turn into a pig my dear
11.txt	said alice seriously
11.txt	mind now !
11.txt	
11.txt	the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence
11.txt	alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home ?
11.txt	
11.txt	when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm 
11.txt	this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further
11.txt	so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood 
11.txt	if it had grown up
11.txt	she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think
11.txt	and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them
11.txt	the cat only grinned when it saw alice 
11.txt	it looked good natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect
11.txt	cheshire puss
11.txt	come it 's pleased so far
11.txt	would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here ?
11.txt	thought alice and she went on  that depends a good deal on where you want to get to
11.txt	i do n't much care where
11.txt	then it does n't matter which way you go
11.txt	so long as i get somewhere
11.txt	oh you 're sure to do that
11.txt	alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question
11.txt	what sort of people live about here ?
11.txt	in that direction
11.txt	the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction
11.txt	visit either you like they 're both mad 
11.txt	waving the other paw lives a march hare  but i do n't want to go among mad people
11.txt	oh you ca n't help that
11.txt	i 'm mad
11.txt	you 're mad 
11.txt	how do you know i 'm mad ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	you must be
11.txt	alice did n't think that proved it at all
11.txt	however she went on and how do you know that you 're mad ?
11.txt	said the cat or you would n't have come here  to begin with
11.txt	said the cat
11.txt	you grant that ?
11.txt	a dog 's not mad 
11.txt	i suppose so
11.txt	well then
11.txt	now i growl when i 'm pleased and wag my tail when i 'm angry 
11.txt	therefore i 'm mad 
11.txt	the cat went on you see a dog growls when it 's angry and wags its tail when it 's pleased 
11.txt	i call it purring not growling
11.txt	call it what you like
11.txt	do you play croquet with the queen to day ?
11.txt	said the cat 
11.txt	i should like it very much
11.txt	said alice but i have n't been invited yet  you 'll see me there
11.txt	alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening 
11.txt	while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again
11.txt	by the bye what became of the baby ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the cat 
11.txt	i 'd nearly forgotten to ask 
11.txt	it turned into a pig
11.txt	i thought it would
11.txt	alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live 
11.txt	i 've seen hatters before
11.txt	as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree
11.txt	did you say pig or fig ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the cat
11.txt	i said pig
11.txt	replied alice
11.txt	and i wish you would n't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy  all right
11.txt	well !
11.txt	i 've often seen a cat without a grin
11.txt	it 's the most curious thing i ever saw in my life !
11.txt	she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur 
11.txt	it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all !
11.txt	i almost wish i 'd gone to see the hatter instead !
11.txt	chapter vii 
11.txt	a mad tea party there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head 
11.txt	thought alice
11.txt	but a grin without a cat ! very uncomfortable for the dormouse
11.txt	the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room !
11.txt	no room !
11.txt	
11.txt	they cried out when they saw alice coming 
11.txt	there 's plenty of room !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table
11.txt	have some wine
11.txt	alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea
11.txt	i do n't see any wine
11.txt	there is n't any
11.txt	then it was n't very civil of you to offer it
11.txt	it was n't very civil of you to sit down without being invited
11.txt	i did n't know it was your table
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	it 's laid for a great many more than three  your hair wants cutting
11.txt	he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech
11.txt	you should learn not to make personal remarks
11.txt	the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this
11.txt	but all he said was why is a raven like a writing desk ?
11.txt	come we shall have some fun now !
11.txt	
11.txt	thought alice 
11.txt	alice said with some severity
11.txt	it 's very rude  i 'm glad they 've begun asking riddles
11.txt	i believe i can guess that
11.txt	do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the march hare
11.txt	exactly so
11.txt	then you should say what you mean
11.txt	i do
11.txt	not the same thing a bit !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the hatter 
11.txt	alice hastily replied
11.txt	at least at least i mean what i say that 's the same thing you know  you might just as well say that
11.txt	i see what i eat
11.txt	is the same thing as
11.txt	i eat what i see
11.txt	! you might just as well say
11.txt	added the march hare that
11.txt	i like what i get
11.txt	is the same thing as
11.txt	i get what i like
11.txt	! you might just as well say
11.txt	added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that
11.txt	i breathe when i sleep
11.txt	is the same thing as
11.txt	i sleep when i breathe
11.txt	! it is the same thing with you
11.txt	the hatter was the first to break the silence 
11.txt	what day of the month is it ?
11.txt	
11.txt	he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear
11.txt	alice considered a little and then said the fourth 
11.txt	two days wrong !
11.txt	
11.txt	sighed the hatter 
11.txt	i told you butter would n't suit the works !
11.txt	
11.txt	he added looking angrily at the march hare
11.txt	it was the best butter
11.txt	yes but some crumbs must have got in as well
11.txt	the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know 
11.txt	alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity 
11.txt	what a funny watch !
11.txt	
11.txt	she remarked 
11.txt	it tells the day of the month and does n't tell what oclock it is !
11.txt	why should it ?
11.txt	
11.txt	muttered the hatter 
11.txt	does your watch tell you what year it is ?
11.txt	the hatter grumbled you should n't have put it in with the bread knife  of course not
11.txt	alice replied very readily but that 's because it stays the same year for such a long time together  which is just the case with mine
11.txt	alice felt dreadfully puzzled 
11.txt	the hatter 's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english 
11.txt	i do n't quite understand you
11.txt	the dormouse is asleep again
11.txt	the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course
11.txt	just what i was going to remark myself 
11.txt	have you guessed the riddle yet ?
11.txt	
11.txt	the hatter said turning to alice again
11.txt	no i give it up
11.txt	alice replied what 's the answer ?
11.txt	i have n't the slightest idea
11.txt	nor i
11.txt	alice sighed wearily 
11.txt	i think you might do something better with the time
11.txt	she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers  if you knew time as well as i do
11.txt	it 's him 
11.txt	said the hatter you would n't talk about wasting it 
11.txt	i do n't know what you mean
11.txt	of course you do n't !
11.txt	
11.txt	the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously
11.txt	i dare say you never even spoke to time !
11.txt	perhaps not
11.txt	alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music
11.txt	ah ! that accounts for it
11.txt	he wo n't stand beating
11.txt	now if you only kept on good terms with him he 'd do almost anything you liked with the clock 
11.txt	for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons you 'd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling !
11.txt	half past one time for dinner !
11.txt	[
11.txt	i only wish it was
11.txt	the march hare said to itself in a whisper  that would be grand certainly
11.txt	said alice thoughtfully but then i should n't be hungry for it you know  not at first perhaps
11.txt	is that the way you manage ?
11.txt	
11.txt	alice asked
11.txt	the hatter shook his head mournfully 
11.txt	not i !
11.txt	
11.txt	he replied 
11.txt	we quarrelled last march just before he went mad you know
11.txt	pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing
11.txt	how i wonder what you 're at !
11.txt	you know the song perhaps ?
11.txt	i 've heard something like it
11.txt	it goes on you know
11.txt	the hatter continued in this way
11.txt	twinkle twinkle
11.txt	here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle
11.txt	well i 'd hardly finished the first verse
11.txt	said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out
11.txt	off with his head !
11.txt	he 's murdering the time !
11.txt	exclaimed alice
11.txt	and ever since that
11.txt	it 's always six oclock now 
11.txt	a bright idea came into alice 's head 
11.txt	is that the reason so many tea things are put out here ?
11.txt	
11.txt	she asked
11.txt	yes that 's it
11.txt	then you keep moving round i suppose ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	exactly so
11.txt	but what happens when you come to the beginning again ?
11.txt	
11.txt	alice ventured to ask
11.txt	suppose we change the subject
11.txt	i 'm getting tired of this 
11.txt	i vote the young lady tells us a story 
11.txt	i 'm afraid i do n't know one
11.txt	then the dormouse shall !
11.txt	
11.txt	they both cried 
11.txt	wake up dormouse !
11.txt	
11.txt	and they pinched it on both sides at once
11.txt	the dormouse slowly opened his eyes 
11.txt	i was n't asleep
11.txt	he said in a hoarse feeble voice
11.txt	tell us a story !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the march hare
11.txt	yes please do !
11.txt	
11.txt	pleaded alice
11.txt	and be quick about it
11.txt	added the hatter or you 'll be asleep again before it 's done  once upon a time there were three little sisters
11.txt	the dormouse began in a great hurry
11.txt	and their names were elsie lacie and tillie
11.txt	and they lived at the bottom of a well
11.txt	said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking
11.txt	they lived on treacle
11.txt	they could n't have done that you know
11.txt	alice gently remarked
11.txt	they 'd have been ill
11.txt	so they were
11.txt	said the dormouse
11.txt	very ill
11.txt	alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well ? take some more tea
11.txt	i 've had nothing yet
11.txt	alice replied in an offended tone so i ca n't take more  you mean you ca n't take less
11.txt	said the hatter it 's very easy to take more than nothing  nobody asked your opinion
11.txt	who 's making personal remarks now ?
11.txt	
11.txt	the hatter asked triumphantly
11.txt	alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question 
11.txt	why did they live at the bottom of a well ?
11.txt	the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treacle well 
11.txt	there 's no such thing !
11.txt	
11.txt	alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh !
11.txt	sh !
11.txt	
11.txt	and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you ca n't be civil you 'd better finish the story for yourself 
11.txt	no please go on !
11.txt	
11.txt	alice said very humbly
11.txt	i dare say there may be one 
11.txt	one indeed !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the dormouse indignantly 
11.txt	however he consented to go on 
11.txt	i wo n't interrupt again  and so these three little sisters they were learning to draw you know
11.txt	said alice quite forgetting her promise
11.txt	treacle
11.txt	i want a clean cup
11.txt	he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouse 's place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare 
11.txt	the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate
11.txt	alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but i do n't understand 
11.txt	where did they draw the treacle from ?
11.txt	you can draw water out of a water well
11.txt	said the hatter
11.txt	so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well eh stupid ? but they were in the well
11.txt	of course they were
11.txt	this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it
11.txt	they were learning to draw
11.txt	the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy
11.txt	and they drew all manner of things everything that begins with an m
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	why not ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the march hare
11.txt	alice was silent
11.txt	the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze
11.txt	but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as mouse traps and the moon and memory and muchness you know you say things are
11.txt	much of a muchness
11.txt	did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness ? really now you ask me
11.txt	said alice very much confused
11.txt	i do n't think
11.txt	then you should n't talk
11.txt	this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off
11.txt	the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot
11.txt	at any rate i 'll never go there again !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice as she picked her way through the wood 
11.txt	it 's the stupidest tea party i ever was at in all my life !
11.txt	just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it 
11.txt	that 's very curious !
11.txt	
11.txt	she thought 
11.txt	but everything 's curious today 
11.txt	i think i may as well go in at once
11.txt	
11.txt	and in she went
11.txt	once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table 
11.txt	now i 'll manage better this time
11.txt	then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains
11.txt	chapter viii 
11.txt	the queen 's croquet ground a large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red 
11.txt	alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five !
11.txt	do n't go splashing paint over me like that !
11.txt	i could n't help it
11.txt	on which seven looked up and said that 's right five !
11.txt	always lay the blame on others !
11.txt	you 'd better not talk !
11.txt	
11.txt	said five 
11.txt	i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded !
11.txt	what for ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the one who had spoken first
11.txt	that 's none of your business two !
11.txt	
11.txt	said seven
11.txt	yes it is his business !
11.txt	
11.txt	said five and i 'll tell him it was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions 
11.txt	seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things
11.txt	would you tell me
11.txt	five and seven said nothing but looked at two 
11.txt	two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we put a white one in by mistake
11.txt	and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know
11.txt	so you see miss we 're doing our best afore she comes to
11.txt	the queen !
11.txt	
11.txt	and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces 
11.txt	there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen
11.txt	first came ten soldiers carrying clubs
11.txt	these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers
11.txt	these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did 
11.txt	after these came the royal children
11.txt	there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts 
11.txt	next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her 
11.txt	then followed the knave of hearts carrying the king 's crown on a crimson velvet cushion
11.txt	and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts
11.txt	alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions
11.txt	and besides what would be the use of a procession
11.txt	so she stood still where she was and waited
11.txt	when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this ?
11.txt	
11.txt	she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply
11.txt	idiot !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the queen tossing her head impatiently
11.txt	and turning to alice she went on what 's your name child ?
11.txt	my name is alice so please your majesty
11.txt	i need n't be afraid of them !
11.txt	and who are these ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree
11.txt	for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children
11.txt	how should i know ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice surprised at her own courage 
11.txt	it 's no business of mine 
11.txt	the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head !
11.txt	off
11.txt	said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent
11.txt	the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear she is only a child !
11.txt	the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over !
11.txt	the knave did so very carefully with one foot
11.txt	get up !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else
11.txt	leave off that !
11.txt	
11.txt	screamed the queen 
11.txt	you make me giddy
11.txt	
11.txt	and then turning to the rose tree she went on what have you been doing here ?
11.txt	may it please your majesty
11.txt	said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying
11.txt	said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses
11.txt	off with their heads !
11.txt	
11.txt	and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection
11.txt	you sha n't be beheaded !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice and she put them into a large flower pot that stood near 
11.txt	the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others
11.txt	are their heads off ?
11.txt	
11.txt	shouted the queen
11.txt	their heads are gone if it please your majesty !
11.txt	
11.txt	the soldiers shouted in reply
11.txt	that 's right !
11.txt	
11.txt	shouted the queen 
11.txt	can you play croquet ?
11.txt	the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her
11.txt	yes !
11.txt	
11.txt	shouted alice
11.txt	come on then !
11.txt	
11.txt	roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next
11.txt	it 's it 's a very fine day !
11.txt	
11.txt	said a timid voice at her side 
11.txt	she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face
11.txt	very
11.txt	said alice where 's the duchess ?
11.txt	hush !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the rabbit in a low hurried tone 
11.txt	he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered she 's under sentence of execution 
11.txt	what for ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	did you say
11.txt	what a pity !
11.txt	the rabbit asked
11.txt	no i did n't
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	i do n't think it 's at all a pity  i said
11.txt	what for ?
11.txt	she boxed the queen 's ears
11.txt	alice gave a little scream of laughter 
11.txt	oh hush !
11.txt	
11.txt	the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone 
11.txt	the queen will hear you !
11.txt	the rabbit began  you see she came rather late and the queen said
11.txt	shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other
11.txt	however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began 
11.txt	alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life
11.txt	it was all ridges and furrows
11.txt	the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches
11.txt	the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed
11.txt	the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs
11.txt	and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head !
11.txt	
11.txt	or off with her head !
11.txt	
11.txt	about once in a minute
11.txt	alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then
11.txt	they 're dreadfully fond of beheading people here
11.txt	the great wonder is that there 's any one left alive !
11.txt	she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself it 's the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to 
11.txt	how are you getting on ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with
11.txt	alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded 
11.txt	it 's no use speaking to it
11.txt	in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her 
11.txt	the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared
11.txt	i do n't think they play at all fairly
11.txt	how do you like the queen ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the cat in a low voice
11.txt	not at all
11.txt	said alice she 's so extremely
11.txt	the queen smiled and passed on
11.txt	who are you talking to ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the king going up to alice and looking at the cat 's head with great curiosity
11.txt	it 's a friend of mine a cheshire cat
11.txt	said alice allow me to introduce it 
11.txt	i do n't like the look of it at all
11.txt	said the king however it may kiss my hand if it likes 
11.txt	i 'd rather not
11.txt	do n't be impertinent
11.txt	he got behind alice as he spoke
11.txt	a cat may look at a king
11.txt	i 've read that in some book but i do n't remember where 
11.txt	said alice  well it must be removed
11.txt	i wish you would have this cat removed !
11.txt	the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small
11.txt	off with his head !
11.txt	
11.txt	she said without even looking round
11.txt	i 'll fetch the executioner myself
11.txt	alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queen 's voice in the distance screaming with passion 
11.txt	she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not 
11.txt	so she went in search of her hedgehog
11.txt	the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree
11.txt	by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it does n't matter much
11.txt	so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend
11.txt	when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable
11.txt	the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said
11.txt	the executioner 's argument was that you could n't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he was n't going to begin at his time of life
11.txt	the king 's argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you were n't to talk nonsense
11.txt	the queen 's argument was that if something was n't done about it in less than no time she 'd have everybody executed all round 
11.txt	it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious 
11.txt	alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess you 'd better ask her about it 
11.txt	she 's in prison
11.txt	and the executioner went off like an arrow
11.txt	the cat 's head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared
11.txt	so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game
11.txt	chapter ix 
11.txt	the mock turtle 's story you ca n't think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing !
11.txt	said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice 's and they walked off together
11.txt	alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen
11.txt	when i 'm a duchess
11.txt	she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though
11.txt	i wo n't have any pepper in my kitchen at all  soup does very well without maybe it 's always pepper that makes people hot tempered
11.txt	she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered  i only wish people knew that then they would n't be so stingy about it you know
11.txt	you 're thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk 
11.txt	i ca n't tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit 
11.txt	she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear  perhaps it has n't one
11.txt	tut tut child !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the duchess 
11.txt	everything 's got a moral if only you can find it
11.txt	
11.txt	and she squeezed herself up closer to alice 's side as she spoke
11.txt	alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly
11.txt	and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice 's shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin 
11.txt	however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could
11.txt	the game 's going on rather better now
11.txt	tis so
11.txt	said the duchess and the moral of that is
11.txt	oh t is love t is love that makes the world go round !
11.txt	somebody said
11.txt	ah well !
11.txt	alice whispered that it 's done by everybody minding their own business ! it means much the same thing
11.txt	said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alice 's shoulder as she added and the moral of that is
11.txt	take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves 
11.txt	alice thought to herself
11.txt	i dare say you 're wondering why i do n't put my arm round your waist
11.txt	shall i try the experiment ?
11.txt	the duchess said after a pause the reason is that i 'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo  he might bite
11.txt	very true
11.txt	said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite  and the moral of that is
11.txt	birds of a feather flock together 
11.txt	only mustard is n't a bird
11.txt	right as usual
11.txt	said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things ! it 's a mineral i think
11.txt	of course it is
11.txt	said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said
11.txt	there 's a large mustard mine near here  and the moral of that is
11.txt	the more there is of mine the less there is of yours 
11.txt	exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark it 's a vegetable 
11.txt	it does n't look like one but it is 
11.txt	oh i know !
11.txt	i quite agree with you
11.txt	said the duchess
11.txt	and the moral of that is
11.txt	be what you would seem to be
11.txt	or if you 'd like it put more simply
11.txt	never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise 
11.txt	i think i should understand that better
11.txt	alice said very politely if i had it written down but i ca n't quite follow it as you say it  that 's nothing to what i could say if i chose
11.txt	pray do n't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that
11.txt	oh do n't talk about trouble !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the duchess 
11.txt	i make you a present of everything i 've said as yet 
11.txt	thought alice 
11.txt	i 'm glad they do n't give birthday presents like that !
11.txt	
11.txt	but she did not venture to say it out loud
11.txt	thinking again ?
11.txt	
11.txt	the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin
11.txt	i 've a right to think
11.txt	just about as much right
11.txt	said the duchess as pigs have to fly
11.txt	and the m
11.txt	but here to alice 's great surprise the duchess 's voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral
11.txt	alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm
11.txt	a fine day your majesty !
11.txt	
11.txt	the duchess began in a low weak voice
11.txt	now i give you fair warning
11.txt	take your choice !
11.txt	the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment
11.txt	let 's go on with the game
11.txt	the other guests had taken advantage of the queen 's absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moment 's delay would cost them their lives
11.txt	all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head !
11.txt	
11.txt	or off with her head !
11.txt	
11.txt	those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution
11.txt	then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet ?
11.txt	no
11.txt	i do n't even know what a mock turtle is 
11.txt	said alice  it 's the thing mock turtle soup is made from
11.txt	i never saw one or heard of one
11.txt	come on then
11.txt	said the queen and he shall tell you his history
11.txt	come that 's a good thing !
11.txt	
11.txt	she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered
11.txt	they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun
11.txt	if you do n't know what a gryphon is look at the picture 
11.txt	up lazy thing !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history 
11.txt	i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered
11.txt	alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited
11.txt	the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled 
11.txt	what fun !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the gryphon half to itself half to alice
11.txt	what is the fun ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	why she
11.txt	it 's all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know 
11.txt	come on !
11.txt	said the gryphon  everybody says
11.txt	come on !
11.txt	here
11.txt	thought alice as she went slowly after it
11.txt	they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break 
11.txt	she pitied him deeply 
11.txt	what is his sorrow ?
11.txt	
11.txt	she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before it 's all his fancy that he has n't got no sorrow you know 
11.txt	come on !
11.txt	so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing
11.txt	this here young lady
11.txt	said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she do 
11.txt	i 'll tell it her
11.txt	so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes 
11.txt	said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and do n't speak a word till i 've finished  alice thought to herself
11.txt	but she waited patiently
11.txt	once
11.txt	said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh
11.txt	these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh !
11.txt	
11.txt	from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle 
11.txt	i was a real turtle  alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story
11.txt	when we were little
11.txt	the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea  the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise
11.txt	alice asked
11.txt	we called him tortoise because he taught us
11.txt	said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull ! you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question
11.txt	at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow !
11.txt	do n't be all day about it !
11.txt	added the gryphon
11.txt	and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth  and he went on in these words yes we went to school in the sea though you may n't believe it
11.txt	interrupted alice
11.txt	you did
11.txt	hold your tongue !
11.txt	
11.txt	added the gryphon before alice could speak again
11.txt	the mock turtle went on
11.txt	we had the best of educations in fact we went to school every day
11.txt	i 've been to a day school too
11.txt	with extras ?
11.txt	
11.txt	asked the mock turtle a little anxiously
11.txt	yes
11.txt	and washing ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the mock turtle
11.txt	certainly not !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice indignantly
11.txt	ah !
11.txt	then yours was n't a really good school
11.txt	said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief  now at ours they had at the end of the bill
11.txt	french music and washing extra 
11.txt	you could n't have wanted it much
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	living at the bottom of the sea 
11.txt	said the mock turtle with a sigh 
11.txt	i only took the regular course 
11.txt	what was that ?
11.txt	
11.txt	inquired alice
11.txt	reeling and writhing of course to begin with
11.txt	the mock turtle replied
11.txt	and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition distraction uglification and derision 
11.txt	i never heard of
11.txt	uglification
11.txt	what is it ?
11.txt	the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise 
11.txt	what !
11.txt	never heard of uglifying !
11.txt	
11.txt	it exclaimed 
11.txt	you know what to beautify is i suppose ?
11.txt	alice ventured to say  yes
11.txt	said alice doubtfully it means to make anything prettier  well then
11.txt	alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn ?
11.txt	the gryphon went on if you do n't know what to uglify is you are a simpleton  well there was mystery
11.txt	what was that like ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	well i ca n't show it you myself
11.txt	the mock turtle said
11.txt	and the gryphon never learnt it 
11.txt	i 'm too stiff  had n't time
11.txt	said the gryphon
11.txt	he was an old crab he was 
11.txt	i never went to him
11.txt	the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to say  so he did so he did
11.txt	and how many hours a day did you do lessons ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice in a hurry to change the subject
11.txt	ten hours the first day
11.txt	what a curious plan !
11.txt	
11.txt	exclaimed alice
11.txt	that 's the reason they 're called lessons
11.txt	this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark 
11.txt	then the eleventh day must have been a holiday ?
11.txt	the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day  of course it was
11.txt	and how did you manage on the twelfth ?
11.txt	
11.txt	alice went on eagerly
11.txt	that 's enough about lessons
11.txt	chapter x 
11.txt	the lobster quadrille the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes 
11.txt	he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice 
11.txt	the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now  same as if he had a bone in his throat
11.txt	said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back  at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again you may not have lived much under the sea
11.txt	[
11.txt	i have n't
11.txt	said alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster
11.txt	alice began to say
11.txt	i once tasted
11.txt	but checked herself hastily and said no never
11.txt	so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is ! no indeed
11.txt	what sort of a dance is it ?
11.txt	said alice  why
11.txt	said the gryphon you first form into a line along the sea shore
11.txt	cried the mock turtle 
11.txt	two lines !
11.txt	seals turtles salmon and so on
11.txt	then when you 've cleared all the jelly fish out of the way
11.txt	that generally takes some time
11.txt	you advance twice
11.txt	cried the gryphon
11.txt	of course
11.txt	the mock turtle said advance twice set to partners
11.txt	change lobsters and retire in same order
11.txt	then you know
11.txt	the mock turtle went on you throw the
11.txt	shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air
11.txt	as far out to sea as you can
11.txt	screamed the gryphon
11.txt	turn a somersault in the sea !
11.txt	
11.txt	cried the mock turtle capering wildly about
11.txt	change lobsters again !
11.txt	
11.txt	yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice
11.txt	back to land again and that 's all the first figure
11.txt	it must be a very pretty dance
11.txt	would you like to see a little of it ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the mock turtle
11.txt	very much indeed
11.txt	come let 's try the first figure !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the mock turtle to the gryphon
11.txt	we can do without lobsters you know 
11.txt	which shall sing ?
11.txt	oh you sing
11.txt	i 've forgotten the words 
11.txt	said the gryphon  so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly
11.txt	will you walk a little faster ?
11.txt	said a whiting to a snail
FAILURE with line [11.txt	344], exception: ValueError('not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)',)
11.txt	see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance !
11.txt	they are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance ?
11.txt	will you wo n't you will you wo n't you will you join the dance ?
11.txt	will you wo n't you will you wo n't you wo n't you join the dance ?
11.txt	you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea !
11.txt	but the snail replied
11.txt	too far too far !
11.txt	and gave a look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance
11.txt	would not could not would not could not would not join the dance
11.txt	would not could not would not could not could not join the dance
11.txt	what matters it how far we go ?
11.txt	his scaly friend replied
FAILURE with line [11.txt	353], exception: ValueError('not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)',)
11.txt	the further off from england the nearer is to france then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance
11.txt	will you wo n't you will you wo n't you will you join the dance ?
11.txt	will you wo n't you will you wo n't you wo n't you join the dance ?
11.txt	thank you it 's a very interesting dance to watch
11.txt	said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song about the whiting ! oh as to the whiting
11.txt	said the mock turtle they you 've seen them of course ? yes
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	i 've often seen them at dinn
11.txt	i do n't know where dinn may be
11.txt	said the mock turtle but if you 've seen them so often of course you know what they 're like 
11.txt	i believe so
11.txt	they have their tails in their mouths and they 're all over crumbs 
11.txt	alice replied thoughtfully  you 're wrong about the crumbs
11.txt	said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea  but they have their tails in their mouths
11.txt	and the reason is
11.txt	here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes
11.txt	tell her about the reason and all that
11.txt	the reason is
11.txt	so they got thrown out to sea 
11.txt	so they had to fall a long way 
11.txt	so they got their tails fast in their mouths 
11.txt	so they could n't get them out again 
11.txt	that 's all 
11.txt	said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance  thank you
11.txt	i never knew so much about a whiting before 
11.txt	said alice it 's very interesting 
11.txt	i can tell you more than that if you like
11.txt	do you know why it 's called a whiting ?
11.txt	said the gryphon 
11.txt	i never thought about it
11.txt	why ?
11.txt	it does the boots and shoes
11.txt	
11.txt	the gryphon replied very solemnly
11.txt	alice was thoroughly puzzled 
11.txt	does the boots and shoes !
11.txt	
11.txt	she repeated in a wondering tone
11.txt	why what are your shoes done with ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the gryphon 
11.txt	i mean what makes them so shiny ?
11.txt	alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer 
11.txt	they 're done with blacking i believe 
11.txt	boots and shoes under the sea
11.txt	now you know 
11.txt	and what are they made of ?
11.txt	
11.txt	alice asked in a tone of great curiosity
11.txt	soles and eels of course
11.txt	the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that  if i 'd been the whiting
11.txt	said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song
11.txt	i 'd have said to the porpoise
11.txt	keep back please we do n't want you with us !
11.txt	they were obliged to have him with them
11.txt	would n't it really ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice in a tone of great surprise
11.txt	of course not
11.txt	said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say
11.txt	with what porpoise ?
11.txt	do n't you mean
11.txt	purpose
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	i mean what i say
11.txt	and the gryphon added come let 's hear some of your adventures 
11.txt	the mock turtle replied in an offended tone 
11.txt	i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning
11.txt	said alice a little timidly but it 's no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then  explain all that
11.txt	no no !
11.txt	the adventures first
11.txt	so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit 
11.txt	she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on 
11.txt	said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time  her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william
11.txt	to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said that 's very curious  it 's all about as curious as it can be
11.txt	it all came different !
11.txt	
11.txt	the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully 
11.txt	i should like to hear her try and repeat something now 
11.txt	tell her to begin
11.txt	
11.txt	he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice
11.txt	stand up and repeat
11.txt	t is the voice of the sluggard
11.txt	how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons !
11.txt	thought alice
11.txt	i might as well be at school at once
11.txt	however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed
11.txt	tis the voice of the lobster
11.txt	i heard him declare
11.txt	you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair 
11.txt	[ later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound 
11.txt	as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes  ] that 's different from what i used to say when i was a child
11.txt	well i never heard it before
11.txt	alice said nothing
11.txt	she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again
11.txt	i should like to have it explained
11.txt	she ca n't explain it
11.txt	go on with the next verse 
11.txt	but about his toes ?
11.txt	
11.txt	the mock turtle persisted 
11.txt	how could he turn them out with his nose you know ?
11.txt	it 's the first position in dancing
11.txt	
11.txt	alice said
11.txt	but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject
11.txt	go on with the next verse
11.txt	the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins
11.txt	i passed by his garden 
11.txt	alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice
11.txt	i passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie
11.txt	when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet ] what is the use of repeating all that stuff
11.txt	it 's by far the most confusing thing i ever heard !
11.txt	the mock turtle interrupted if you do n't explain it as you go on ? yes i think you 'd better leave off
11.txt	shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille ?
11.txt	
11.txt	the gryphon went on 
11.txt	or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song ?
11.txt	oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind
11.txt	no accounting for tastes !
11.txt	alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm ! sing her
11.txt	turtle soup
11.txt	the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen !
11.txt	who for such dainties would not stoop ?
11.txt	soup of the evening beautiful soup !
11.txt	soup of the evening beautiful soup !
11.txt	beau ootiful soo oop !
11.txt	beau ootiful soo oop !
11.txt	soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beautiful soup !
11.txt	beautiful soup !
11.txt	who cares for fish game or any other dish ?
11.txt	who would not give all else for two pennyworth only of beautiful soup ?
11.txt	pennyworth only of beautiful soup ?
11.txt	beau ootiful soo oop !
11.txt	beau ootiful soo oop !
11.txt	soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beauti ful soup !
11.txt	chorus again !
11.txt	
11.txt	cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trial 's beginning !
11.txt	
11.txt	was heard in the distance
11.txt	come on !
11.txt	
11.txt	cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song
11.txt	what trial is it ?
11.txt	
11.txt	alice panted as she ran
11.txt	but the gryphon only answered come on !
11.txt	
11.txt	and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words soo oop of the e e evening beautiful beautiful soup !
11.txt	chapter xi 
11.txt	who stole the tarts ?
11.txt	the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him
11.txt	and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other 
11.txt	in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at them
11.txt	i wish they 'd get the trial done
11.txt	but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time
11.txt	alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there 
11.txt	that 's the judge
11.txt	the judge by the way was the king
11.txt	and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming
11.txt	and that 's the jury box
11.txt	thought alice and those twelve creatures
11.txt	she was obliged to say creatures
11.txt	you see because some of them were animals and some were birds
11.txt	she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all 
11.txt	i suppose they are the jurors
11.txt	however jury men
11.txt	the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates 
11.txt	what are they doing ?
11.txt	
11.txt	alice whispered to the gryphon 
11.txt	they ca n't have anything to put down yet before the trial 's begun 
11.txt	they 're putting down their names
11.txt	stupid things !
11.txt	
11.txt	alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court !
11.txt	
11.txt	and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking
11.txt	alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things !
11.txt	
11.txt	on their slates and she could even make out that one of them did n't know how to spell stupid
11.txt	a nice muddle their slates 'll be in before the trial 's over !
11.txt	
11.txt	thought alice
11.txt	one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked 
11.txt	this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away 
11.txt	she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it
11.txt	so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day
11.txt	and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate
11.txt	herald read the accusation !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the king
11.txt	on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away !
11.txt	consider your verdict
11.txt	not yet not yet !
11.txt	
11.txt	the rabbit hastily interrupted 
11.txt	there 's a great deal to come before that !
11.txt	call the first witness
11.txt	the first witness was the hatter 
11.txt	he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other 
11.txt	said the king
11.txt	and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness ! i beg pardon your majesty
11.txt	he began for bringing these in but i had n't quite finished my tea when i was sent for  you ought to have finished
11.txt	when did you begin ?
11.txt	the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arm in arm with the dormouse 
11.txt	said the king  fourteenth of march i think it was
11.txt	fifteenth
11.txt	sixteenth
11.txt	write that down
11.txt	take off your hat
11.txt	it is n't mine
11.txt	stolen !
11.txt	
11.txt	the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact
11.txt	i keep them to sell
11.txt	the hatter added as an explanation
11.txt	i 'm a hatter 
11.txt	here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted
11.txt	give your evidence
11.txt	this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter
11.txt	just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court
11.txt	but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her
11.txt	i wish you would n't squeeze so
11.txt	
11.txt	said the dormouse who was sitting next to her 
11.txt	i can hardly breathe 
11.txt	i ca n't help it
11.txt	said alice very meekly
11.txt	i 'm growing  you 've no right to grow here
11.txt	do n't talk nonsense
11.txt	said alice more boldly you know you 're growing too  yes but i grow at a reasonable pace
11.txt	and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court
11.txt	all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert !
11.txt	
11.txt	on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off
11.txt	give your evidence
11.txt	the king repeated angrily or i 'll have you executed whether you 're nervous or not 
11.txt	i 'm a poor man your majesty
11.txt	the hatter began in a trembling voice and i had n't begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the bread and butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea
11.txt	said the king
11.txt	it began with the tea
11.txt	of course twinkling begins with a t !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the king sharply 
11.txt	do you take me for a dunce ?
11.txt	go on !
11.txt	i 'm a poor man
11.txt	the hatter went on and most things twinkled after that only the march hare said
11.txt	the march hare interrupted in a great hurry
11.txt	you did !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the hatter
11.txt	i deny it !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the march hare
11.txt	he denies it
11.txt	said the king leave out that part  well at any rate the dormouse said
11.txt	after that
11.txt	continued the hatter
11.txt	i cut some more bread and butter
11.txt	one of the jury asked
11.txt	that i ca n't remember
11.txt	you must remember
11.txt	the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee 
11.txt	remarked the king or i 'll have you executed  i 'm a poor man your majesty
11.txt	you 're a very poor speaker
11.txt	here one of the guinea pigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court 
11.txt	as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done 
11.txt	they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea pig head first and then sat upon it 
11.txt	i 'm glad i 've seen that done
11.txt	thought alice  i 've so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials
11.txt	there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court
11.txt	and i never understood what it meant till now  if that 's all you know about it you may stand down
11.txt	i ca n't go no lower
11.txt	said the hatter
11.txt	i 'm on the floor as it is  then you may sit down
11.txt	here the other guinea pig cheered and was suppressed
11.txt	come that finished the guinea pigs !
11.txt	
11.txt	thought alice 
11.txt	now we shall get on better 
11.txt	i 'd rather finish my tea
11.txt	you may go
11.txt	and just take his head off outside
11.txt	call the next witness !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the king
11.txt	the next witness was the duchess 's cook 
11.txt	she carried the pepper box in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once
11.txt	give your evidence
11.txt	sha n't
11.txt	the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must cross examine this witness 
11.txt	well if i must i must
11.txt	the king said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of ? pepper mostly
11.txt	treacle
11.txt	collar that dormouse
11.txt	behead that dormouse !
11.txt	turn that dormouse out of court !
11.txt	suppress him !
11.txt	pinch him !
11.txt	off with his whiskers !
11.txt	for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared
11.txt	never mind !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the king with an air of great relief 
11.txt	call the next witness
11.txt	
11.txt	and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must cross examine the next witness 
11.txt	it quite makes my forehead ache !
11.txt	alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they have n't got much evidence yet
11.txt	imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice !
11.txt	chapter xii 
11.txt	alice 's evidence here !
11.txt	
11.txt	cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before
11.txt	oh i beg your pardon !
11.txt	
11.txt	she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box or they would die
11.txt	the trial can not proceed
11.txt	said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places all
11.txt	alice looked at the jury box and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move 
11.txt	she soon got it out again and put it right
11.txt	not that it signifies much
11.txt	she said to herself
11.txt	as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court
11.txt	what do you know about this business ?
11.txt	
11.txt	the king said to alice
11.txt	nothing
11.txt	nothing whatever ?
11.txt	
11.txt	persisted the king
11.txt	nothing whatever
11.txt	that 's very important
11.txt	the king said turning to the jury  they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course
11.txt	unimportant of course i meant
11.txt	the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone important unimportant unimportant important
11.txt	some of the jury wrote it down important
11.txt	and some unimportant  alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates
11.txt	but it does n't matter a bit
11.txt	at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note book cackled out silence !
11.txt	
11.txt	and read out from his book rule forty two 
11.txt	all persons more than a mile high to leave the court 
11.txt	everybody looked at alice
11.txt	i 'm not a mile high
11.txt	you are
11.txt	nearly two miles high
11.txt	well i sha n't go at any rate
11.txt	said alice besides that 's not a regular rule you invented it just now  it 's the oldest rule in the book
11.txt	then it ought to be number one
11.txt	the king turned pale and shut his note book hastily 
11.txt	consider your verdict
11.txt	there 's more evidence to come yet please your majesty
11.txt	what 's in it ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said the queen
11.txt	i have n't opened it yet
11.txt	said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody  it must have been that
11.txt	who is it directed to ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said one of the jurymen
11.txt	it is n't directed at all
11.txt	he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it is n't a letter after all it 's a set of verses 
11.txt	are they in the prisoner 's handwriting ?
11.txt	
11.txt	asked another of the jurymen
11.txt	no they 're not
11.txt	the jury all looked puzzled 
11.txt	said the white rabbit and that 's the queerest thing about it
11.txt	he must have imitated somebody else 's hand
11.txt	the jury all brightened up again 
11.txt	said the king  please your majesty
11.txt	said the knave
11.txt	i did n't write it and they ca n't prove i did there 's no name signed at the end  if you did n't sign it
11.txt	you must have meant some mischief or else you 'd have signed your name like an honest man 
11.txt	there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day
11.txt	that proves his guilt
11.txt	it proves nothing of the sort !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice 
11.txt	why you do n't even know what they 're about !
11.txt	read them
11.txt	the white rabbit put on his spectacles 
11.txt	where shall i begin please your majesty ?
11.txt	
11.txt	he asked
11.txt	begin at the beginning
11.txt	these were the verses the white rabbit read they told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim
11.txt	he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you ?
11.txt	i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more
11.txt	they all returned from him to you though they were mine before
11.txt	if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were
11.txt	my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it
11.txt	do n't let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me 
11.txt	that 's the most important piece of evidence we 've heard yet
11.txt	said the king rubbing his hands
11.txt	so now let the jury
11.txt	if any one of them can explain it
11.txt	said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she was n't a bit afraid of interrupting him
11.txt	i do n't believe there 's an atom of meaning in it 
11.txt	i 'll give him sixpence  the jury all wrote down on their slates she does n't believe there 's an atom of meaning in it
11.txt	if there 's no meaning in it
11.txt	said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we need n't try to find any  and yet i do n't know
11.txt	he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye
11.txt	i seem to see some meaning in them after all
11.txt	said i could not swim
11.txt	he added turning to the knave
11.txt	the knave shook his head sadly 
11.txt	do i look like it ?
11.txt	
11.txt	he said 
11.txt	which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard 
11.txt	all right so far
11.txt	said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself
11.txt	we know it to be true
11.txt	that 's the jury of course
11.txt	i gave her one they gave him two
11.txt	why that must be what he did with the tarts you know
11.txt	but it goes on
11.txt	they all returned from him to you
11.txt	why there they are !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table 
11.txt	nothing can be clearer than that 
11.txt	then again
11.txt	before she had this fit
11.txt	he said to the queen
11.txt	never !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke 
11.txt	the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark
11.txt	but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted 
11.txt	then the words do n't fit you
11.txt	there was a dead silence
11.txt	it 's a pun !
11.txt	
11.txt	the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict
11.txt	no no !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the queen 
11.txt	sentence first verdict afterwards 
11.txt	stuff and nonsense !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice loudly 
11.txt	the idea of having the sentence first !
11.txt	hold your tongue !
11.txt	
11.txt	said the queen turning purple
11.txt	i wo n't !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice
11.txt	off with her head !
11.txt	
11.txt	the queen shouted at the top of her voice 
11.txt	nobody moved
11.txt	who cares for you ?
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice she had grown to her full size by this time 
11.txt	you 're nothing but a pack of cards !
11.txt	at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face
11.txt	wake up alice dear !
11.txt	
11.txt	said her sister
11.txt	why what a long sleep you 've had !
11.txt	oh i 've had such a curious dream !
11.txt	
11.txt	said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about
11.txt	and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea
11.txt	it 's getting late
11.txt	
11.txt	so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been
11.txt	but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister 's dream
11.txt	the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never ending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig baby was sneezing on the duchess 's knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizard 's slate pencil and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle
11.txt	so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the queen 's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle 's heavy sobs
11.txt	lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after time be herself a grown woman
11.txt	and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own child life and the happy summer days

113.txt	in the garden chapter i there is no one left when mary lennox was sent to misselthwaite manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable looking child ever seen
113.txt	it was true too 
113.txt	she had a little thin face and a little thin body thin light hair and a sour expression 
113.txt	her hair was yellow and her face was yellow because she had been born in india and had always been ill in one way or another 
113.txt	her father had held a position under the english government and had always been busy and ill himself and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people 
113.txt	she had not wanted a little girl at all and when mary was born she handed her over to the care of an ayah who was made to understand that if she wished to please the mem sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible 
113.txt	so when she was a sickly fretful ugly little baby she was kept out of the way and when she became a sickly fretful toddling thing she was kept out of the way also 
113.txt	she never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her ayah and the other native servants and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything because the mem sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived 
113.txt	the young english governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one 
113.txt	so if mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all
113.txt	one frightfully hot morning when she was about nine years old she awakened feeling very cross and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her ayah
113.txt	why did you come ?
113.txt	she said to the strange woman 
113.txt	send my ayah to me 
113.txt	i will not let you stay
113.txt	there was something mysterious in the air that morning 
113.txt	nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing while those whom mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces 
113.txt	but no one would tell her anything and her ayah did not come 
113.txt	she was actually left alone as the morning went on and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda 
113.txt	she pretended that she was making a flower bed and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call saidie when she returned
113.txt	pig !
113.txt	pig ! daughter of pigs !
113.txt	she said because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all
113.txt	she was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with someone 
113.txt	she was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices
113.txt	mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy 
113.txt	she had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from england 
113.txt	the child stared at him but she stared most at her mother 
113.txt	she always did this when she had a chance to see her because the mem sahib mary used to call her that oftener than anything else was such a tall slim pretty person and wore such lovely clothes 
113.txt	her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things and she had large laughing eyes 
113.txt	all her clothes were thin and floating and mary said they were
113.txt	full of lace
113.txt	they looked fuller of lace than ever this morning but her eyes were not laughing at all
113.txt	they were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer 's face
113.txt	is it so very bad ? oh is it ?
113.txt	mary heard her say
113.txt	awfully
113.txt	the young man answered in a trembling voice
113.txt	lennox 
113.txt	you ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago
113.txt	oh i know i ought !
113.txt	she cried 
113.txt	what a fool i was !
113.txt	i only stayed to go to that silly dinner party 
113.txt	at that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants
113.txt	the wailing grew wilder and wilder
113.txt	what is it ? what is it ?
113.txt	mrs lennox gasped
113.txt	someone has died
113.txt	answered the boy officer 
113.txt	you did not say it had broken out among your servants 
113.txt	i did not know !
113.txt	the mem sahib cried 
113.txt	come with me !
113.txt	come with me !
113.txt	after that appalling things happened and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to mary 
113.txt	the cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies 
113.txt	the ayah had been taken ill in the night and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts 
113.txt	before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror 
113.txt	there was panic on every side and dying people in all the bungalows
113.txt	during the confusion and bewilderment of the second day mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone 
113.txt	nobody thought of her nobody wanted her and strange things happened of which she knew nothing 
113.txt	mary alternately cried and slept through the hours 
113.txt	she only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds 
113.txt	once she crept into the dining room and found it empty though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason 
113.txt	the child ate some fruit and biscuits and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled 
113.txt	it was sweet and she did not know how strong it was 
113.txt	very soon it made her intensely drowsy and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet 
113.txt	the wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time
113.txt	many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow
113.txt	when she awakened she lay and stared at the wall 
113.txt	the house was perfectly still 
113.txt	she had never known it to be so silent before 
113.txt	she heard neither voices nor footsteps and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over 
113.txt	she wondered also who would take care of her now her ayah was dead 
113.txt	there would be a new ayah and perhaps she would know some new stories 
113.txt	mary had been rather tired of the old ones 
113.txt	she did not cry because her nurse had died 
113.txt	she was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for anyone 
113.txt	the noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive 
113.txt	everyone was too panic stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of 
113.txt	when people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves 
113.txt	but if everyone had got well again surely someone would remember and come to look for her
113.txt	but no one came and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent 
113.txt	she heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels 
113.txt	she was not frightened because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room 
113.txt	he slipped under the door as she watched him
113.txt	how queer and quiet it is
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	it sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake 
113.txt	they were men 's footsteps and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices 
113.txt	no one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms
113.txt	what desolation !
113.txt	she heard one voice say
113.txt	i suppose the child too 
113.txt	i heard there was a child though no one ever saw her 
113.txt	she looked an ugly cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected 
113.txt	the first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father 
113.txt	he looked tired and troubled but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back
113.txt	barney !
113.txt	he cried out 
113.txt	a child alone !
113.txt	in a place like this !
113.txt	mercy on us who is she !
113.txt	there is a child here !
113.txt	i am mary lennox
113.txt	she thought the man was very rude to call her father 's bungalow
113.txt	a place like this !
113.txt	why does nobody come ?
113.txt	i fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and i have only just wakened up 
113.txt	it is the child no one ever saw !
113.txt	exclaimed the man turning to his companions 
113.txt	she has actually been forgotten !
113.txt	why was i forgotten ?
113.txt	mary said stamping her foot 
113.txt	why does nobody come ?
113.txt	mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away
113.txt	poor little kid !
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	there is nobody left to come 
113.txt	that was why the place was so quiet 
113.txt	it was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake
113.txt	chapter ii mistress mary quite contrary mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone 
113.txt	she did not miss her at all in fact and as she was a self absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself as she had always done 
113.txt	if she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world but she was very young and as she had always been taken care of she supposed she always would be
113.txt	what she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to nice people who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her ayah and the other native servants had done
113.txt	she knew that she was not going to stay at the english clergyman 's house where she was taken at first 
113.txt	she did not want to stay 
113.txt	the english clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other 
113.txt	mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her 
113.txt	by the second day they had given her a nickname which made her furious
113.txt	it was basil who thought of it first 
113.txt	basil was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned up nose and mary hated him 
113.txt	she was playing by herself under a tree just as she had been playing the day the cholera broke out 
113.txt	she was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden and basil came and stood near to watch her 
113.txt	presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion
113.txt	why do n't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery ?
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	there in the middle
113.txt	go away !
113.txt	cried mary 
113.txt	go away !
113.txt	i do n't want boys 
113.txt	he was always teasing his sisters 
113.txt	he danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed
FAILURE with line [113.txt	32], exception: ValueError('not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)',)
113.txt	with silver bells and cockle shells and marigolds all in a row 
113.txt	he sang it until the other children heard and laughed too
113.txt	and the crosser mary got the more they sang
113.txt	mistress mary quite contrary
113.txt	and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her
113.txt	mistress mary quite contrary
113.txt	you are going to be sent home
113.txt	basil said to her
113.txt	and we 're glad of it 
113.txt	at the end of the week 
113.txt	i am glad of it too
113.txt	answered mary 
113.txt	where is home ?
113.txt	she does n't know where home is !
113.txt	said basil with seven year old scorn 
113.txt	our grandmama lives there and our sister mabel was sent to her last year 
113.txt	you are not going to your grandmama 
113.txt	you have none 
113.txt	you are going to your uncle 
113.txt	his name is mr
113.txt	archibald craven

113.txt	i know you do n't
113.txt	basil answered 
113.txt	girls never do 
113.txt	i heard father and mother talking about him 
113.txt	he lives in a great big desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him
113.txt	he 's so cross he wo n't let them and they would n't come if he would let them 
113.txt	he 's a hunchback and he 's horrid 
113.txt	i do n't believe you
113.txt	but she thought over it a great deal afterward
113.txt	and when mrs crawford told her that night that she was going to sail away to england in a few days and go to her uncle mr archibald craven who lived at misselthwaite manor she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her 
113.txt	they tried to be kind to her but she only turned her face away when mrs crawford attempted to kiss her and held herself stiffly when mr crawford patted her shoulder
113.txt	she is such a plain child
113.txt	she had a very pretty manner too and mary has the most unattractive ways i ever saw in a child 
113.txt	and her mother was such a pretty creature  the children call her mistress mary quite contrary
113.txt	and though it 's naughty of them one ca n't help understanding it 
113.txt	it is very sad now the poor beautiful thing is gone to remember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all 
113.txt	perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery mary might have learned some pretty ways too 
113.txt	i believe she scarcely ever looked at her
113.txt	think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that deserted bungalow 
113.txt	colonel mcgrew said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the room 
113.txt	when her ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little thing
113.txt	she was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman mr archibald craven sent to meet her in london 
113.txt	the woman was his housekeeper at misselthwaite manor and her name was mrs medlock 
113.txt	she was a stout woman with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes 
113.txt	she wore a very purple dress a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her head 
113.txt	mary did not like her at all but as she very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that
113.txt	besides which it was very evident mrs medlock did not think much of her
113.txt	my word ! she 's a plain little piece of goods !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	she has n't handed much of it down has she maam ?
113.txt	and we 'd heard that her mother was a beauty 
113.txt	perhaps she will improve as she grows older
113.txt	the officer 's wife said good naturedly 
113.txt	children alter so much 
113.txt	if she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression her features are rather good 
113.txt	she 'll have to alter a good deal
113.txt	answered mrs medlock 
113.txt	and there 's nothing likely to improve children at misselthwaite if you ask me !
113.txt	she was watching the passing buses and cabs and people but she heard quite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he lived in 
113.txt	what sort of a place was it and what would he be like ?
113.txt	what was a hunchback ?
113.txt	she had never seen one 
113.txt	perhaps there were none in india
113.txt	since she had been living in other people 's houses and had had no ayah she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her 
113.txt	she had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to anyone even when her father and mother had been alive 
113.txt	other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers but she had never seemed to really be anyone 's little girl 
113.txt	she had had servants and food and clothes but no one had taken any notice of her 
113.txt	she did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child
113.txt	but then of course she did not know she was disagreeable 
113.txt	she often thought that other people were but she did not know that she was so herself
113.txt	she thought mrs medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen with her common highly colored face and her common fine bonnet
113.txt	when the next day they set out on their journey to yorkshire she walked through the station to the railway carriage with her head up and trying to keep as far away from her as she could because she did not want to seem to belong to her 
113.txt	it would have made her angry to think people imagined she was her little girl
113.txt	but mrs medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts 
113.txt	she was the kind of woman who would
113.txt	stand no nonsense from young ones
113.txt	at least that is what she would have said if she had been asked 
113.txt	she had not wanted to go to london just when her sister maria 's daughter was going to be married but she had a comfortable well paid place as housekeeper at misselthwaite manor and the only way in which she could keep it was to do at once what mr archibald craven told her to do 
113.txt	she never dared even to ask a question
113.txt	captain lennox and his wife died of the cholera
113.txt	mr craven had said in his short cold way 
113.txt	the child is to be brought here 
113.txt	you must go to london and bring her yourself 
113.txt	captain lennox was my wife 's brother and i am their daughter 's guardian
113.txt	mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and fretful 
113.txt	she had nothing to read or to look at and she had folded her thin little black gloved hands in her lap 
113.txt	her black dress made her look yellower than ever and her limp light hair straggled from under her black crepe hat
113.txt	a more marred looking young one i never saw in my life
113.txt	marred is a yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish 
113.txt	she had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything
113.txt	and at last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk hard voice
113.txt	i suppose i may as well tell you something about where you are going to
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	do you know anything about your uncle ?
113.txt	no
113.txt	never heard your father and mother talk about him ?
113.txt	no
113.txt	she frowned because she remembered that her father and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular
113.txt	certainly they had never told her things
113.txt	humph
113.txt	she did not say any more for a few moments and then she began again
113.txt	you are going to a queer place 
113.txt	i suppose you might as well be told something to prepare you
113.txt	the house is six hundred years old and it 's on the edge of the moor and there 's near a hundred rooms in it though most of them 's shut up and locked 
113.txt	not but that it 's a grand big place in a gloomy way and mr craven 's proud of it in his way and that 's gloomy enough too  and there 's pictures and fine old furniture and things that 's been there for ages and there 's a big park round it and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the ground some of them
113.txt	she paused and took another breath 
113.txt	but there 's nothing else
113.txt	mary had begun to listen in spite of herself 
113.txt	it all sounded so unlike india and anything new rather attracted her 
113.txt	but she did not intend to look as if she were interested 
113.txt	that was one of her unhappy disagreeable ways 
113.txt	so she sat still
113.txt	well
113.txt	said mrs medlock 
113.txt	what do you think of it ?
113.txt	nothing
113.txt	she answered 
113.txt	i know nothing about such places
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	she said
113.txt	do n't you care ?
113.txt	but you are like an old woman 
113.txt	it does n't matter
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	whether i care or not 
113.txt	you are right enough there
113.txt	said mrs medlock 
113.txt	what you 're to be kept at misselthwaite manor for i do n't know unless because it 's the easiest way 
113.txt	he 's not going to trouble himself about you that 's sure and certain 
113.txt	he never troubles himself about no one 
113.txt	it does n't
113.txt	he 's got a crooked back
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	he was a sour young man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was married 
113.txt	that set him wrong 
113.txt	she had never thought of the hunchback 's being married and she was a trifle surprised 
113.txt	mrs medlock saw this and as she was a talkative woman she continued with more interest 
113.txt	this was one way of passing some of the time at any rate
113.txt	she was a sweet pretty thing and he 'd have walked the world over to get her a blade o
113.txt	nobody thought she 'd marry him but she did and people said she married him for his money 
113.txt	grass she wanted  but she did n't she did n't
113.txt	positively 
113.txt	when she died
113.txt	oh ! did she die !
113.txt	she exclaimed quite without meaning to 
113.txt	she had just remembered a french fairy story she had once read called
113.txt	riquet a la houppe
113.txt	it had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her suddenly sorry for mr archibald craven
113.txt	yes she died
113.txt	mrs medlock answered 
113.txt	he cares about nobody 
113.txt	he wo n't see people 
113.txt	most of the time he goes away and when he is at misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the west wing and wo n't let anyone but pitcher see him 
113.txt	pitcher 's an old fellow but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his ways 
113.txt	and it made him queerer than ever 
113.txt	a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up and with their doors locked a house on the edge of a moor whatsoever a moor was sounded dreary 
113.txt	a man with a crooked back who shut himself up also !
113.txt	she stared out of the window with her lips pinched together and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window panes 
113.txt	if the pretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by being something like her own mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she had done in frocks
113.txt	full of lace
113.txt	but she was not there any more
113.txt	you need n't expect to see him because ten to one you wo n't
113.txt	medlock 
113.txt	said mrs 
113.txt	you 'll have to play about and look after yourself 
113.txt	you 'll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms you 're to keep out of
113.txt	there 's gardens enough 
113.txt	but when you 're in the house do n't go wandering and poking about 
113.txt	mr craven wo n't have it 
113.txt	i shall not want to go poking about
113.txt	and she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever 
113.txt	she watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell asleep
113.txt	chapter iii across the moor she slept a long time and when she awakened mrs medlock had bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea 
113.txt	the rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs 
113.txt	the guard lighted the lamps in the carriage and mrs medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef 
113.txt	she ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself and mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows 
113.txt	it was quite dark when she awakened again 
113.txt	the train had stopped at a station and mrs medlock was shaking her
113.txt	you have had a sleep !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	we 're at thwaite station and we 've got a long drive before us 
113.txt	it 's time to open your eyes !
113.txt	the little girl did not offer to help her because in india native servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one
113.txt	the station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train 
113.txt	the station master spoke to mrs medlock in a rough good natured way pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which mary found out afterward was yorkshire
113.txt	i see tha 's got back
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	an
113.txt	tha 's browt th
113.txt	young un with thee 
113.txt	aye that 's her
113.txt	how 's thy missus ?
113.txt	well enow  th
113.txt	carriage is waitin
113.txt	outside for thee 
113.txt	mary saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her in 
113.txt	his long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was the burly station master included
113.txt	when he shut the door mounted the box with the coachman and they drove off the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner but she was not inclined to go to sleep again 
113.txt	she sat and looked out of the window curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the queer place mrs medlock had spoken of 
113.txt	she was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up a house standing on the edge of a moor
113.txt	what is a moor ?
113.txt	she said suddenly to mrs medlock
113.txt	look out of the window in about ten minutes and you 'll see
113.txt	the woman answered 
113.txt	you wo n't see much because it 's a dark night but you can see something 
113.txt	we 've got to drive five miles across missel moor before we get to the manor 
113.txt	the carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they passed 
113.txt	after they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house 
113.txt	then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set out for sale 
113.txt	then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and trees 
113.txt	after that there seemed nothing different for a long time or at least it seemed a long time to her
113.txt	at last the horses began to go more slowly as if they were climbing up hill and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees 
113.txt	she could see nothing in fact but a dense darkness on either side 
113.txt	she leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt
113.txt	eh ! we 're on the moor now sure enough
113.txt	the carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them
113.txt	a wind was rising and making a singular wild low rushing sound
113.txt	it 's it 's not the sea is it ?
113.txt	said mary looking round at her companion
113.txt	no not it
113.txt	answered mrs medlock 
113.txt	nor it is n't fields nor mountains it 's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep 
113.txt	i feel as if it might be the sea if there were water on it
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	it sounds like the sea just now 
113.txt	that 's the wind blowing through the bushes
113.txt	mrs medlock said 
113.txt	it 's a wild dreary enough place to my mind though there 's plenty that likes it particularly when the heather 's in bloom 
113.txt	the road went up and down and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise 
113.txt	mary felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land
113.txt	i do n't like it
113.txt	she said to herself 
113.txt	i do n't like it
113.txt	the horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight of a light 
113.txt	mrs medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief
113.txt	eh i am glad to see that bit o
113.txt	light twinkling
113.txt	we shall get a good cup of tea after a bit at all events 
113.txt	it 's the light in the lodge window 
113.txt	it was
113.txt	after a bit
113.txt	they drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but low built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court 
113.txt	at first mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow
113.txt	the entrance door was a huge one made of massive curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars 
113.txt	it opened into an enormous hall which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made mary feel that she did not want to look at them 
113.txt	as she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small odd little black figure and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked
113.txt	a neat thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them
113.txt	you are to take her to her room
113.txt	he said in a husky voice 
113.txt	he 's going to london in the morning 
113.txt	he does n't want to see her 
113.txt	very well mr pitcher
113.txt	mrs medlock answered 
113.txt	so long as i know what 's expected of me i can manage 
113.txt	what 's expected of you mrs medlock
113.txt	mr pitcher said
113.txt	is that you make sure that he 's not disturbed and that he does n't see what he does n't want to see
113.txt	mrs medlock said unceremoniously
113.txt	this room and the next are where you 'll live and you must keep to them 
113.txt	do n't you forget that !
113.txt	well here you are !
113.txt	chapter iv martha when she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth rug raking out the cinders noisily 
113.txt	mary lay and watched her for a few moments and then began to look about the room 
113.txt	she had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy 
113.txt	the walls were covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it 
113.txt	there were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle 
113.txt	there were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies 
113.txt	mary felt as if she were in the forest with them 
113.txt	out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it and to look rather like an endless dull purplish sea
113.txt	what is that ?
113.txt	she said pointing out of the window
113.txt	martha the young housemaid who had just risen to her feet looked and pointed also
113.txt	that there ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	yes 
113.txt	that 's th
113.txt	moor
113.txt	with a good natured grin 
113.txt	does tha
113.txt	like it ?
113.txt	no
113.txt	answered mary 
113.txt	i hate it 
113.txt	that 's because thart not used to it
113.txt	martha said going back to her hearth 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	thinks it 's too big an
113.txt	bare now  but tha
113.txt	will like it 
113.txt	do you ?
113.txt	inquired mary
113.txt	aye that i do
113.txt	answered martha cheerfully polishing away at the grate 
113.txt	it 's none bare 
113.txt	i just love it  it 's covered wi
113.txt	growin
113.txt	things as smells sweet  it 's fair lovely in spring an

113.txt	an
113.txt	singin
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	 i would n't live away from th
113.txt	moor for anythin
113.txt	
113.txt	the native servants she had been used to in india were not in the least like this
113.txt	they were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals 
113.txt	they made salaams and called them
113.txt	protector of the poor
113.txt	indian servants were commanded to do things not asked 
113.txt	and names of that sort  it was not the custom to say
113.txt	please
113.txt	and
113.txt	thank you
113.txt	she wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her in the face 
113.txt	she was a round rosy good natured looking creature but she had a sturdy way which made mistress mary wonder if she might not even slap back if the person who slapped her was only a little girl
113.txt	you are a strange servant
113.txt	martha sat up on her heels with her blacking brush in her hand and laughed without seeming the least out of temper
113.txt	eh ! i know that
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	if there was a grand missus at misselthwaite i should never have been even one of th
113.txt	i might have been let to be scullerymaid but i 'd never have been let upstairs 
113.txt	under housemaids  i 'm too common an
113.txt	but this is a funny house for all it 's so grand 
113.txt	i talk too much yorkshire  seems like there 's neither master nor mistress except mr pitcher an
113.txt	mrs medlock  mr craven he wo n't be troubled about anythin
113.txt	when he 's here an
113.txt	he 's nearly always away  mrs medlock gave me th
113.txt	place out o
113.txt	she told me she could never have done it if misselthwaite had been like other big houses 
113.txt	kindness 
113.txt	are you going to be my servant ?
113.txt	mary asked still in her imperious little indian way
113.txt	martha began to rub her grate again
113.txt	i 'm mrs medlock 's servant
113.txt	she said stoutly 
113.txt	an
113.txt	craven 's but i 'm to do the housemaid 's work up here an
113.txt	wait on you a bit  but you wo n't need much waitin
113.txt	on 
113.txt	who is going to dress me ?
113.txt	demanded mary
113.txt	martha sat up on her heels again and stared 
113.txt	she spoke in broad yorkshire in her amazement
113.txt	canna
113.txt	tha
113.txt	dress thysen !
113.txt	she said
113.txt	what do you mean ? i do n't understand your language
113.txt	eh ! i forgot
113.txt	martha said 
113.txt	mrs medlock told me i 'd have to be careful or you would n't know what i was sayin
113.txt	i mean ca n't you put on your own clothes ?
113.txt	
113.txt	no
113.txt	answered mary quite indignantly 
113.txt	my ayah dressed me of course 
113.txt	i never did in my life 
113.txt	well
113.txt	said martha evidently not in the least aware that she was impudent
113.txt	it 's time tha
113.txt	should learn  tha
113.txt	it 'll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit 
113.txt	my mother always said she could n't see why grand people 's children did n't turn out fair fools what with nurses an
113.txt	bein
113.txt	washed an
113.txt	dressed an
113.txt	took out to walk as if they was puppies !
113.txt	it is different in india
113.txt	she could scarcely stand this
113.txt	but martha was not at all crushed
113.txt	eh ! i can see it 's different
113.txt	she answered almost sympathetically 
113.txt	i dare say it 's because there 's such a lot o
113.txt	blacks there instead o
113.txt	respectable white people  when i heard you was comin
113.txt	from india i thought you was a black too
113.txt	what !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	you thought i was a native 
113.txt	you you daughter of a pig !
113.txt	what !
113.txt	who are you callin
113.txt	names ?
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	you need n't be so vexed  that 's not th
113.txt	way for a young lady to talk  i 've nothin
113.txt	against th

113.txt	you always read as a black 's a man an
113.txt	a brother  i 've never seen a black an

113.txt	you do n't know anything about natives !
113.txt	they are not people they 're servants who must salaam to you
113.txt	you know nothing about india 
113.txt	you know nothing about anything !
113.txt	she sobbed so unrestrainedly that good natured yorkshire martha was a little frightened and quite sorry for her 
113.txt	she went to the bed and bent over her
113.txt	eh ! you must n't cry like that there !
113.txt	she begged 
113.txt	i did n't know you 'd be vexed 
113.txt	you must n't for sure  i do n't know anythin
113.txt	i beg your pardon miss 
113.txt	about anythinjust like you said  do stop cryin
113.txt	
113.txt	she gradually ceased crying and became quiet 
113.txt	martha looked relieved
113.txt	it 's time for thee to get up now
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	mrs medlock said i was to carry tha
113.txt	breakfast an
113.txt	tea an
113.txt	dinner into th
113.txt	it 's been made into a nursery for thee 
113.txt	i 'll help thee on with thy clothes if tha 'll get out o
113.txt	bed  if th
113.txt	buttons are at th
113.txt	back tha
113.txt	can not button them up thaself
113.txt	those are not mine
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	mine are black 
113.txt	she looked the thick white wool coat and dress over and added with cool approval
113.txt	those are nicer than mine 
113.txt	these are th
113.txt	ones tha
113.txt	must put on
113.txt	martha answered 
113.txt	mr craven ordered mrs medlock to get em in london  he said
113.txt	i wo n't have a child dressed in black wanderin
113.txt	about like a lost soul
113.txt	it 'd make the place sadder than it is 
113.txt	put color on her
113.txt	
113.txt	mother she said she knew what he meant 
113.txt	mother always knows what a body means 
113.txt	she does n't hold with black hersel
113.txt	
113.txt	i hate black things
113.txt	the dressing process was one which taught them both something 
113.txt	martha had
113.txt	buttoned up
113.txt	why does n't tha
113.txt	put on tha
113.txt	own shoes ?
113.txt	she said when mary quietly held out her foot
113.txt	my ayah did it
113.txt	answered mary staring 
113.txt	it was the custom 
113.txt	she said that very often
113.txt	it was the custom
113.txt	the native servants were always saying it 
113.txt	if one told them to do a thing their ancestors had not done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said
113.txt	it is not the custom
113.txt	it had not been the custom that mistress mary should do anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll but before she was ready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at misselthwaite manor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new to her things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings and picking up things she let fall 
113.txt	if martha had been a well trained fine young lady 's maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and would have known that it was her business to brush hair and button boots and pick things up and lay them away 
113.txt	she was however only an untrained yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones who were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumble over things
113.txt	if mary lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she would perhaps have laughed at martha 's readiness to talk but mary only listened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner 
113.txt	at first she was not at all interested but gradually as the girl rattled on in her good tempered homely way mary began to notice what she was saying
113.txt	eh ! you should see em all
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	there 's twelve of us an
113.txt	i can tell you my mother 's put to it to get porridge for em all 
113.txt	my father only gets sixteen shilling a week  they tumble about on th
113.txt	moor an
113.txt	play there all day an
113.txt	mother says th
113.txt	air of th
113.txt	she says she believes they eat th
113.txt	grass same as th
113.txt	our dickon he 's twelve years old and he 's got a young pony he calls his own 
113.txt	where did he get it ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	he found it on th
113.txt	moor with its mother when it was a little one an
113.txt	he began to make friends with it an
113.txt	give it bits o
113.txt	bread an
113.txt	pluck young grass for it  and it got to like him so it follows him about an
113.txt	it lets him get on its back  dickon 's a kind lad an
113.txt	animals likes him 
113.txt	so she began to feel a slight interest in dickon and as she had never before been interested in anyone but herself it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment 
113.txt	when she went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her she found that it was rather like the one she had slept in 
113.txt	it was not a child 's room but a grown up person 's room with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs 
113.txt	a table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast 
113.txt	but she had always had a very small appetite and she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate martha set before her
113.txt	i do n't want it
113.txt	tha
113.txt	does n't want thy porridge !
113.txt	martha exclaimed incredulously
113.txt	no 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	does n't know how good it is  put a bit o
113.txt	treacle on it or a bit o
113.txt	sugar 
113.txt	i do n't want it
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	i ca n't abide to see good victuals go to waste  if our children was at this table they 'd clean it bare in five minutes
113.txt	why ?
113.txt	said mary coldly
113.txt	why !
113.txt	echoed martha 
113.txt	because they scarce ever had their stomachs full in their lives  they 're as hungry as young hawks an
113.txt	foxes 
113.txt	i do n't know what it is to be hungry
113.txt	martha looked indignant
113.txt	well it would do thee good to try it  i can see that plain enough
113.txt	she said outspokenly 
113.txt	i 've no patience with folk as sits an
113.txt	just stares at good bread an
113.txt	my word !
113.txt	meat  do n't i wish dickon and phil an
113.txt	jane an
113.txt	th
113.txt	rest of em had what 's here under their pinafores 
113.txt	why do n't you take it to them ?
113.txt	suggested mary
113.txt	it 's not mine
113.txt	answered martha stoutly 
113.txt	an
113.txt	this is n't my day out  i get my day out once a month same as th
113.txt	rest  then i go home an
113.txt	clean up for mother an
113.txt	give her a day 's rest
113.txt	you wrap up warm an
113.txt	run out an
113.txt	play you
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	it 'll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat 
113.txt	there were gardens and paths and big trees but everything looked dull and wintry
113.txt	why should i go out on a day like this ?
113.txt	out ?
113.txt	well if tha
113.txt	does n't go out thalt have to stay in an
113.txt	what has tha
113.txt	got to do ?
113.txt	there was nothing to do 
113.txt	when mrs medlock had prepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement 
113.txt	perhaps it would be better to go and see what the gardens were like
113.txt	who will go with me ?
113.txt	she inquired
113.txt	martha stared
113.txt	you 'll go by yourself
113.txt	she answered
113.txt	our dickon goes off on th
113.txt	moor by himself an
113.txt	plays for hours  that 's how he made friends with th
113.txt	pony  he 's got sheep on th
113.txt	moor that knows him an
113.txt	birds as comes an
113.txt	eats out of his hand  however little there is to eat he always saves a bit o
113.txt	his bread to coax his pets 
113.txt	there would be birds outside though there would not be ponies or sheep 
113.txt	they would be different from the birds in india and it might amuse her to look at them
113.txt	martha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots and she showed her her way downstairs
113.txt	if tha
113.txt	goes round that way tha 'll come to th
113.txt	gardens
113.txt	she said pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery 
113.txt	there 's lots o
113.txt	flowers in summer time but there 's nothin
113.txt	bloomin
113.txt	now
113.txt	she seemed to hesitate a second before she added
113.txt	one of th
113.txt	gardens is locked up  no one has been in it for ten years
113.txt	why ?
113.txt	asked mary in spite of herself 
113.txt	here was another locked door added to the hundred in the strange house
113.txt	he wo n't let no one go inside 
113.txt	it was her garden 
113.txt	mr craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden  he locked th
113.txt	door an
113.txt	dug a hole and buried th
113.txt	there 's mrs medlock 's bell ringing i must run 
113.txt	key 
113.txt	she could not help thinking about the garden which no one had been into for ten years 
113.txt	she wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it 
113.txt	when she had passed through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens with wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders 
113.txt	there were trees and flower beds and evergreens clipped into strange shapes and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst 
113.txt	but the flower beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing 
113.txt	this was not the garden which was shut up 
113.txt	how could a garden be shut up ?
113.txt	you could always walk into a garden
113.txt	she was just thinking this when she saw that at the end of the path she was following there seemed to be a long wall with ivy growing over it 
113.txt	she was not familiar enough with england to know that she was coming upon the kitchen gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing 
113.txt	she went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy and that it stood open 
113.txt	this was not the closed garden evidently and she could go into it
113.txt	she went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all round it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to open into one another 
113.txt	she saw another open green door revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables 
113.txt	fruit trees were trained flat against the wall and over some of the beds there were glass frames 
113.txt	the place was bare and ugly enough mary thought as she stood and stared about her 
113.txt	it might be nicer in summer when things were green but there was nothing pretty about it now
113.txt	presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the door leading from the second garden 
113.txt	he looked startled when he saw mary and then touched his cap 
113.txt	he had a surly old face and did not seem at all pleased to see her but then she was displeased with his garden and wore her
113.txt	quite contrary
113.txt	what is this place ?
113.txt	she asked
113.txt	one o
113.txt	th
113.txt	kitchen gardens
113.txt	what is that ?
113.txt	said mary pointing through the other green door
113.txt	another of em
113.txt	shortly 
113.txt	there 's another on tother side o
113.txt	th
113.txt	wall an
113.txt	there 's th
113.txt	orchard tother side o
113.txt	that 
113.txt	can i go in them ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	if tha
113.txt	but there 's nowt to see 
113.txt	likes 
113.txt	she went down the path and through the second green door 
113.txt	there she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open 
113.txt	perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years 
113.txt	as she was not at all a timid child and always did what she wanted to do mary went to the green door and turned the handle 
113.txt	she hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious garden but it did open quite easily and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard 
113.txt	there were walls all round it also and trees trained against them and there were bare fruit trees growing in the winter browned grass but there was no green door to be seen anywhere 
113.txt	mary looked for it and yet when she had entered the upper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem to end with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side 
113.txt	she could see the tops of trees above the wall and when she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of them and suddenly he burst into his winter song almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her
113.txt	she stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful friendly little whistle gave her a pleased feeling even a disagreeable little girl may be lonely and the big closed house and big bare moor and big bare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in the world but herself 
113.txt	if she had been an affectionate child who had been used to being loved she would have broken her heart but even though she was
113.txt	mistress mary quite contrary
113.txt	she listened to him until he flew away 
113.txt	he was not like an indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she should ever see him again 
113.txt	perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden and knew all about it
113.txt	perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought so much of the deserted garden 
113.txt	she was curious about it and wanted to see what it was like 
113.txt	why had mr archibald craven buried the key ?
113.txt	if he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden ?
113.txt	she wondered if she should ever see him but she knew that if she did she should not like him and he would not like her and that she should only stand and stare at him and say nothing though she should be wanting dreadfully to ask him why he had done such a queer thing
113.txt	people never like me and i never like people
113.txt	she thought 
113.txt	they were always talking and laughing and making noises 
113.txt	and i never can talk as the crawford children could
113.txt	i believe that tree was in the secret garden i feel sure it was
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	there was a wall round the place and there was no door 
113.txt	she went and stood beside him and watched him a few moments in her cold little way 
113.txt	he took no notice of her and so at last she spoke to him
113.txt	i have been into the other gardens
113.txt	there was nothin
113.txt	to prevent thee
113.txt	i went into the orchard 
113.txt	there was no dog at th
113.txt	door to bite thee
113.txt	there was no door there into the other garden
113.txt	what garden ?
113.txt	he said in a rough voice stopping his digging for a moment
113.txt	the one on the other side of the wall
113.txt	answered mistress mary 
113.txt	a bird with a red breast was sitting on one of them and he sang 
113.txt	there are trees there i saw the tops of them 
113.txt	a slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite different 
113.txt	it made her think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked when he smiled 
113.txt	she had not thought of it before
113.txt	he turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began to whistle a low soft whistle 
113.txt	she could not understand how such a surly man could make such a coaxing sound
113.txt	almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened 
113.txt	she heard a soft little rushing flight through the air and it was the bird with the red breast flying to them and he actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near to the gardener 's foot
113.txt	here he is
113.txt	where has tha
113.txt	been tha
113.txt	cheeky little beggar ?
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i 've not seen thee before today  has tha begun tha
113.txt	courtin
113.txt	this early in th
113.txt	thart too forrad 
113.txt	season ?
113.txt	he seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid 
113.txt	he hopped about and pecked the earth briskly looking for seeds and insects 
113.txt	it actually gave mary a queer feeling in her heart because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person 
113.txt	he had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak and slender delicate legs
113.txt	will he always come when you call him ?
113.txt	she asked almost in a whisper
113.txt	i 've knowed him ever since he was a fledgling 
113.txt	aye that he will  he come out of th
113.txt	nest in th
113.txt	other garden an
113.txt	when first he flew over th
113.txt	wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an
113.txt	we got friendly  when he went over th
113.txt	wall again th
113.txt	rest of th
113.txt	brood was gone an
113.txt	he was lonely an
113.txt	he come back to me 
113.txt	what kind of a bird is he ?
113.txt	mary asked
113.txt	does n't tha
113.txt	know ? he 's a robin redbreast an
113.txt	they 're th
113.txt	they 're almost as friendly as dogs if you know how to get on with em 
113.txt	friendliest curiousest birds alive  watch him peckin
113.txt	about there an
113.txt	lookin
113.txt	round at us now an
113.txt	again  he knows we 're talkin
113.txt	about him 
113.txt	he looked at the plump little scarlet waistcoated bird as if he were both proud and fond of him
113.txt	he 's a conceited one
113.txt	he chuckled 
113.txt	he likes to hear folk talk about him  an
113.txt	curious bless me there never was his like for curiosity an
113.txt	meddlin
113.txt	 he 's always comin
113.txt	to see what i 'm plantin
113.txt	 he knows all th
113.txt	things mester craven never troubles hissel
113.txt	to find out  he 's th
113.txt	head gardener he is 
113.txt	mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed at her with great curiosity 
113.txt	it really seemed as if he were finding out all about her 
113.txt	the queer feeling in her heart increased
113.txt	where did the rest of the brood fly to ?
113.txt	she asked
113.txt	there 's no knowin
113.txt	 the old ones turn em out o
113.txt	their nest an
113.txt	make em fly an
113.txt	they 're scattered before you know it  this one was a knowin
113.txt	one an
113.txt	he knew he was lonely
113.txt	i 'm lonely
113.txt	she had not known before that this was one of the things which made her feel sour and cross 
113.txt	she seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her and she looked at the robin
113.txt	the old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her a minute
113.txt	art tha
113.txt	th
113.txt	little wench from india ?
113.txt	he asked
113.txt	mary nodded
113.txt	then no wonder thart lonely  thalt be lonlier before tha 's done
113.txt	he began to dig again driving his spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed
113.txt	what is your name ?
113.txt	mary inquired
113.txt	he stood up to answer her
113.txt	ben weatherstaff
113.txt	he answered and then he added with a surly chuckle
113.txt	i 'm lonely mysel
113.txt	except when he 's with me
113.txt	and he jerked his thumb toward the robin 
113.txt	he 's th
113.txt	only friend i 've got 
113.txt	i have no friends at all
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	my ayah did n't like me and i never played with anyone 
113.txt	i never had
113.txt	tha
113.txt	an
113.txt	me are a good bit alike
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	we was wove out of th
113.txt	same cloth  we 're neither of us good lookin
113.txt	an
113.txt	we 've got the same nasty tempers both of us i 'll warrant 
113.txt	we 're both of us as sour as we look 
113.txt	native servants always salaamed and submitted to you whatever you did 
113.txt	she had never thought much about her looks but she wondered if she was as unattractive as ben weatherstaff and she also wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came 
113.txt	this was plain speaking and mary lennox had never heard the truth about herself in her life  she actually began to wonder also if she was
113.txt	nasty tempered
113.txt	she felt uncomfortable
113.txt	suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turned round 
113.txt	she was standing a few feet from a young apple tree and the robin had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff laughed outright
113.txt	what did he do that for ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	he 's made up his mind to make friends with thee
113.txt	replied ben 
113.txt	dang me if he has n't took a fancy to thee 
113.txt	to me ?
113.txt	said mary and she moved toward the little tree softly and looked up
113.txt	would you make friends with me ?
113.txt	she said to the robin just as if she was speaking to a person 
113.txt	would you ?
113.txt	and she did not say it either in her hard little voice or in her imperious indian voice but in a tone so soft and eager and coaxing that ben weatherstaff was as surprised as she had been when she heard him whistle
113.txt	why
113.txt	he cried out
113.txt	tha
113.txt	said that as nice an
113.txt	human as if tha
113.txt	was a real child instead of a sharp old woman  tha
113.txt	said it almost like dickon talks to his wild things on th
113.txt	moor 
113.txt	do you know dickon ?
113.txt	mary asked turning round rather in a hurry
113.txt	everybody knows him  dickon 's wanderin
113.txt	about everywhere  th
113.txt	very blackberries an
113.txt	heather bells knows him  i warrant th
113.txt	foxes shows him where their cubs lies an
113.txt	th
113.txt	skylarks does n't hide their nests from him 
113.txt	she was almost as curious about dickon as she was about the deserted garden 
113.txt	but just that moment the robin who had ended his song gave a little shake of his wings spread them and flew away 
113.txt	he had made his visit and had other things to do
113.txt	he has flown over the wall !
113.txt	mary cried out watching him 
113.txt	he has flown into the orchard he has flown across the other wall into the garden where there is no door !
113.txt	he lives there
113.txt	said old ben 
113.txt	he came out o
113.txt	th
113.txt	egg there  if he 's courtin
113.txt	he 's makin
113.txt	up to some young madam of a robin that lives among th
113.txt	old rose trees there 
113.txt	rose trees
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	are there rose trees ?
113.txt	there was ten year
113.txt	ago

113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	there must be a door somewhere 
113.txt	where is the green door ?
113.txt	there was ten year
113.txt	ago but there is n't now
113.txt	no door !

113.txt	there must be

113.txt	get you gone an
113.txt	i 've no more time 
113.txt	play you
113.txt	chapter v the cry in the corridor at first each day which passed by for mary lennox was exactly like the others 
113.txt	every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found martha kneeling upon the hearth building her fire
113.txt	every morning she ate her breakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it
113.txt	and after each breakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky and after she had stared for a while she realized that if she did not go out she would have to stay in and do nothing and so she went out 
113.txt	she did not know that this was the best thing she could have done and she did not know that when she began to walk quickly or even run along the paths and down the avenue she was stirring her slow blood and making herself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor 
113.txt	she ran only to make herself warm and she hated the wind which rushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could not see 
113.txt	but the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it
113.txt	but after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened one morning knowing what it was to be hungry and when she sat down to her breakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it away but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it until her bowl was empty
113.txt	tha
113.txt	got on well enough with that this mornin
113.txt	did n't tha
113.txt	?
113.txt	said martha
113.txt	it tastes nice today
113.txt	it 's th
113.txt	air of th
113.txt	moor that 's givin
113.txt	thee stomach for tha
113.txt	victuals
113.txt	answered martha 
113.txt	it 's lucky for thee that tha 's got victuals as well as appetite  there 's been twelve in our cottage as had th
113.txt	stomach an
113.txt	nothin
113.txt	to put in it  you go on playin
113.txt	you out o
113.txt	doors every day an
113.txt	you 'll get some flesh on your bones an
113.txt	you wo n't be so yeller 
113.txt	i do n't play
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i have nothing to play with 
113.txt	nothin
113.txt	to play with !
113.txt	exclaimed martha 
113.txt	our children plays with sticks and stones  they just runs about an
113.txt	shouts an
113.txt	looks at things
113.txt	mary did not shout but she looked at things 
113.txt	there was nothing else to do 
113.txt	she walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the paths in the park 
113.txt	sometimes she looked for ben weatherstaff but though several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or was too surly 
113.txt	once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose
113.txt	one place she went to oftener than to any other 
113.txt	it was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls round them 
113.txt	there were bare flower beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly 
113.txt	there was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere 
113.txt	it seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected 
113.txt	the rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all
113.txt	a few days after she had talked to ben weatherstaff mary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so 
113.txt	she had just paused and was looking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp and there on the top of the wall perched ben weatherstaff 's robin redbreast tilting forward to look at her with his small head on one side
113.txt	oh !
113.txt	she cried out
113.txt	is it you is it you ?
113.txt	and it did not seem at all queer to her that she spoke to him as if she were sure that he would understand and answer her
113.txt	he did answer 
113.txt	he twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he were telling her all sorts of things 
113.txt	it seemed to mistress mary as if she understood him too though he was not speaking in words 
113.txt	it was as if he said
113.txt	is n't the wind nice ?
113.txt	is n't the sun nice ?
113.txt	is n't everything nice ?
113.txt	let us both chirp and hop and twitter 
113.txt	come on !
113.txt	come on !
113.txt	good morning !
113.txt	poor little thin sallow ugly mary she actually looked almost pretty for a moment
113.txt	i like you ! i like you !
113.txt	she cried out pattering down the walk
113.txt	and she chirped and tried to whistle which last she did not know how to do in the least 
113.txt	but the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled back at her 
113.txt	at last he spread his wings and made a darting flight to the top of a tree where he perched and sang loudly
113.txt	that reminded mary of the first time she had seen him 
113.txt	he had been swinging on a tree top then and she had been standing in the orchard
113.txt	now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall much lower down and there was the same tree inside
113.txt	it 's in the garden no one can go into
113.txt	she said to herself 
113.txt	he lives in there 
113.txt	how i wish i could see what it is like !
113.txt	it 's the garden without a door 
113.txt	then she ran down the path through the other door and then into the orchard and when she stood and looked up there was the tree on the other side of the wall and there was the robin just finishing his song and beginning to preen his feathers with his beak
113.txt	it is the garden
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i am sure it is 
113.txt	then she ran through the kitchen gardens again and out into the walk outside the long ivy covered wall and she walked to the end of it and looked at it but there was no door
113.txt	and then she walked to the other end looking again but there was no door
113.txt	it 's very queer
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	but there must have been one ten years ago because mr craven buried the key 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff said there was no door and there is no door 
113.txt	in india she had always felt hot and too languid to care much about anything 
113.txt	the fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a little
113.txt	she stayed out of doors nearly all day and when she sat down to her supper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable 
113.txt	she did not feel cross when martha chattered away 
113.txt	she felt as if she rather liked to hear her and at last she thought she would ask her a question 
113.txt	she asked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on the hearth rug before the fire
113.txt	why did mr craven hate the garden ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	she had made martha stay with her and martha had not objected at all
113.txt	she was very young and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and sisters and she found it dull in the great servants
113.txt	hall downstairs where the footman and upper housemaids made fun of her yorkshire speech and looked upon her as a common little thing and sat and whispered among themselves  martha liked to talk and the strange child who had lived in india and been waited upon by
113.txt	blacks
113.txt	she sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked
113.txt	art tha
113.txt	thinkin
113.txt	about that garden yet ?
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i knew tha
113.txt	that was just the way with me when i first heard about it 
113.txt	would 
113.txt	why did he hate it ?
113.txt	mary persisted
113.txt	martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable
113.txt	listen to th
113.txt	wind wutherin
113.txt	round the house
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	you could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it tonight 
113.txt	mary did not know what
113.txt	wutherin
113.txt	it must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which rushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in
113.txt	but one knew he could not get in and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire
113.txt	but why did he hate it so ?
113.txt	she asked after she had listened 
113.txt	she intended to know if martha did
113.txt	then martha gave up her store of knowledge
113.txt	mind
113.txt	she said
113.txt	there 's lots o
113.txt	that 's mr craven 's orders 
113.txt	his troubles are none servants
113.txt	business he says  but for th
113.txt	it was mrs
113.txt	craven 's garden that she had made when first they were married an
113.txt	she just loved it an
113.txt	they used to tend the flowers themselves  an
113.txt	none o
113.txt	th
113.txt	gardeners was ever let to go in  him an
113.txt	her used to go in an
113.txt	shut th
113.txt	door an
113.txt	stay there hours an
113.txt	hours readin
113.txt	and talkin
113.txt	 an
113.txt	she was just a bit of a girl an
113.txt	there was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it  an
113.txt	she made roses grow over it an
113.txt	she used to sit there  but one day when she was sittin
113.txt	there th
113.txt	branch broke an
113.txt	she fell on th
113.txt	ground an
113.txt	was hurt so bad that next day she died  th
113.txt	doctors thought he 'd go out o
113.txt	his mind an
113.txt	that 's why he hates it 
113.txt	die too  no one 's never gone in since an
113.txt	he wo n't let anyone talk about it 
113.txt	mary did not ask any more questions  she looked at the red fire and listened to the wind
113.txt	wutherin
113.txt	it seemed to be
113.txt	wutherin
113.txt	at that moment a very good thing was happening to her 
113.txt	four good things had happened to her in fact since she came to misselthwaite manor
113.txt	she had felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had understood her
113.txt	she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm
113.txt	she had been healthily hungry for the first time in her life
113.txt	and she had found out what it was to be sorry for someone
113.txt	but as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something else 
113.txt	she did not know what it was because at first she could scarcely distinguish it from the wind itself 
113.txt	it was a curious sound it seemed almost as if a child were crying somewhere 
113.txt	sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child crying but presently mistress mary felt quite sure this sound was inside the house not outside it 
113.txt	it was far away but it was inside 
113.txt	she turned round and looked at martha
113.txt	do you hear anyone crying ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	martha suddenly looked confused
113.txt	no
113.txt	she answered 
113.txt	it 's th
113.txt	wind  sometimes it sounds like as if someone was lost on th
113.txt	moor an
113.txt	wailin
113.txt	 it 's got all sorts o
113.txt	sounds 
113.txt	but listen
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	it 's in the house down one of those long corridors
113.txt	there !
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	it is someone crying and it is n't a grown up person 
113.txt	i told you so !
113.txt	martha ran and shut the door and turned the key but before she did it they both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a bang and then everything was quiet for even the wind ceased
113.txt	wutherin
113.txt	it was th
113.txt	wind
113.txt	said martha stubbornly 
113.txt	an
113.txt	if it was n't it was little betty butterworth th
113.txt	scullery maid  she 's had th
113.txt	toothache all day 
113.txt	she did not believe she was speaking the truth
113.txt	chapter vi
113.txt	there was someone crying there was !
113.txt	there could be no going out today
113.txt	what do you do in your cottage when it rains like this ?
113.txt	she asked martha
113.txt	try to keep from under each other 's feet mostly
113.txt	there does seem a lot of us then 
113.txt	mother 's a good tempered woman but she gets fair moithered 
113.txt	eh ! the biggest ones goes out in th
113.txt	cow shed and plays there  dickon he does n't mind th
113.txt	wet  he goes out just th
113.txt	same as if th
113.txt	sun was shinin
113.txt	he says he sees things on rainy days as does n't show when it 's fair weather 
113.txt	 he once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th
113.txt	bosom of his shirt to keep it warm  its mother had been killed nearby an
113.txt	th
113.txt	hole was swum out an
113.txt	th
113.txt	rest o
113.txt	th
113.txt	he 's got it at home now 
113.txt	litter was dead  he found a half drowned young crow another time an
113.txt	he brought it home too an
113.txt	tamed it  it 's named soot because it 's so black an
113.txt	it hops an
113.txt	flies about with him everywhere 
113.txt	she had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away 
113.txt	the stories she had been told by her ayah when she lived in india had been quite unlike those martha had to tell about the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat 
113.txt	the children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough good natured collie puppies 
113.txt	mary was most attracted by the mother and dickon 
113.txt	the time had come when mary had forgotten to resent martha 's familiar talk  when martha told stories of what
113.txt	mother
113.txt	if i had a raven or a fox cub i could play with it
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	but i have nothing
113.txt	can tha
113.txt	knit ?
113.txt	she asked
113.txt	no
113.txt	can tha
113.txt	sew ?
113.txt	no 
113.txt	can tha
113.txt	read ?
113.txt	yes 
113.txt	then why does n't tha read somethin
113.txt	or learn a bit o
113.txt	spellin
113.txt	thast old enough to be learnin
113.txt	thy book a good bit now 
113.txt	i have n't any books
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	those i had were left in india 
113.txt	that 's a pity
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	if mrs medlock 'd let thee go into th
113.txt	library there 's thousands o
113.txt	books there 
113.txt	she made up her mind to go and find it herself
113.txt	she was not troubled about mrs medlock 
113.txt	mrs medlock seemed always to be in her comfortable housekeeper 's sitting room downstairs 
113.txt	in this queer place one scarcely ever saw anyone at all 
113.txt	in fact there was no one to see but the servants and when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs where there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter and a large servants
113.txt	mary 's meals were served regularly and martha waited on her but no one troubled themselves about her in the least 
113.txt	mrs medlock came and looked at her every day or two but no one inquired what she did or told her what to do 
113.txt	she supposed that perhaps this was the english way of treating children 
113.txt	in india she had always been attended by her ayah who had followed her about and waited on her hand and foot 
113.txt	she had often been tired of her company 
113.txt	now she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because martha looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her and put on
113.txt	has n't tha
113.txt	got good sense ?
113.txt	she said once when mary had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her 
113.txt	our susan ann is twice as sharp as thee an
113.txt	she 's only four year
113.txt	old  sometimes tha
113.txt	looks fair soft in th
113.txt	head
113.txt	she stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs 
113.txt	she was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library 
113.txt	she did not care very much about the library itself because she had read very few books
113.txt	but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors 
113.txt	she wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them 
113.txt	were there a hundred really ?
113.txt	why should n't she go and see how many doors she could count ?
113.txt	it would be something to do on this morning when she could not go out 
113.txt	she had never been taught to ask permission to do things and she knew nothing at all about authority so she would not have thought it necessary to ask mrs medlock if she might walk about the house even if she had seen her
113.txt	she opened the door of the room and went into the corridor and then she began her wanderings 
113.txt	it was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to others again 
113.txt	there were doors and doors and there were pictures on the walls 
113.txt	sometimes they were pictures of dark curious landscapes but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer grand costumes made of satin and velvet 
113.txt	she found herself in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits 
113.txt	she had never thought there could be so many in any house 
113.txt	she walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her
113.txt	she felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from india was doing in their house 
113.txt	some were pictures of children little girls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair or with big ruffs around their necks 
113.txt	she always stopped to look at the children and wonder what their names were and where they had gone and why they wore such odd clothes 
113.txt	there was a stiff plain little girl rather like herself 
113.txt	she wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her finger 
113.txt	her eyes had a sharp curious look
113.txt	where do you live now ?
113.txt	said mary aloud to her 
113.txt	i wish you were here 
113.txt	it seemed as if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small self wandering about upstairs and down through narrow passages and wide ones where it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever walked 
113.txt	since so many rooms had been built people must have lived in them but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it true
113.txt	it was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning the handle of a door 
113.txt	all the doors were shut as mrs medlock had said they were but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it 
113.txt	she was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened 
113.txt	it was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom 
113.txt	there were embroidered hangings on the wall and inlaid furniture such as she had seen in india stood about the room 
113.txt	a broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor
113.txt	and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff plain little girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever
113.txt	perhaps she slept here once
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	she stares at me so that she makes me feel queer 
113.txt	she saw so many rooms that she became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred though she had not counted them 
113.txt	in all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them 
113.txt	there were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them
113.txt	in one room which looked like a lady 's sitting room the hangings were all embroidered velvet and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants made of ivory 
113.txt	they were of different sizes and some had their mahouts or palanquins on their backs 
113.txt	some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies 
113.txt	mary had seen carved ivory in india and she knew all about elephants 
113.txt	she opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these for quite a long time 
113.txt	when she got tired she set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet
113.txt	in all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms she had seen nothing alive
113.txt	but in this room she saw something 
113.txt	just after she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound
113.txt	it made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace from which it seemed to come 
113.txt	in the corner of the sofa there was a cushion and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it
113.txt	mary crept softly across the room to look 
113.txt	the bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there 
113.txt	six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her 
113.txt	if there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all
113.txt	if they would n't be so frightened i would take them back with me
113.txt	she had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther and she turned back 
113.txt	two or three times she lost her way by turning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down until she found the right one
113.txt	but at last she reached her own floor again though she was some distance from her own room and did not know exactly where she was
113.txt	i believe i have taken a wrong turning again
113.txt	she said standing still at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall 
113.txt	how still everything is !
113.txt	i do n't know which way to go 
113.txt	it was another cry but not quite like the one she had heard last night
113.txt	it was only a short one a fretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls
113.txt	it 's nearer than it was
113.txt	and it is crying 
113.txt	the tapestry was the covering of a door which fell open and showed her that there was another part of the corridor behind it and mrs medlock was coming up it with her bunch of keys in her hand and a very cross look on her face
113.txt	what are you doing here ?
113.txt	she said and she took mary by the arm and pulled her away 
113.txt	what did i tell you ?
113.txt	i turned round the wrong corner
113.txt	explained mary 
113.txt	i did n't know which way to go and i heard someone crying
113.txt	she quite hated mrs medlock at the moment but she hated her more the next
113.txt	you did n't hear anything of the sort
113.txt	said the housekeeper 
113.txt	you come along back to your own nursery or i 'll box your ears
113.txt	now
113.txt	she said
113.txt	the master had better get you a governess same as he said he would 
113.txt	you 're one that needs someone to look sharp after you 
113.txt	i 've got enough to do 
113.txt	you stay where you 're told to stay or you 'll find yourself locked up 
113.txt	she did not cry but ground her teeth
113.txt	there was someone crying there was there was !
113.txt	she had heard it twice now and sometime she would find out 
113.txt	she had found out a great deal this morning 
113.txt	she felt as if she had been on a long journey and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all the time and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion
113.txt	chapter vii the key to the garden two days after this when mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed immediately and called to martha
113.txt	look at the moor !
113.txt	look at the moor !
113.txt	the wind itself had ceased and a brilliant deep blue sky arched high over the moorland 
113.txt	never never had mary dreamed of a sky so blue 
113.txt	in india skies were hot and blazing
113.txt	this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake and here and there high high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow white fleece 
113.txt	the far reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple black or awful dreary gray
113.txt	aye
113.txt	said martha with a cheerful grin 
113.txt	th
113.txt	it does like this at this time o
113.txt	th

113.txt	springtime 's on its way  it 's a long way off yet but it 's comin
113.txt	
113.txt	i thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in england
113.txt	eh ! no !
113.txt	said martha sitting up on her heels among her black lead brushes 
113.txt	nowt o
113.txt	th
113.txt	soart !
113.txt	what does that mean ?
113.txt	asked mary seriously 
113.txt	in india the natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood so she was not surprised when martha used words she did not know
113.txt	martha laughed as she had done the first morning
113.txt	there now
113.txt	she said
113.txt	medlock said i must n't 
113.txt	nowt o
113.txt	th

113.txt	 you 'll want to get out on it at sunrise an
113.txt	live out on it all day like dickon does 
113.txt	could i ever get there ?
113.txt	asked mary wistfully looking through her window at the far off blue 
113.txt	it was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color
113.txt	i do n't know
113.txt	answered martha 
113.txt	tha 's never used tha
113.txt	legs since tha
113.txt	was born it seems to me  tha
113.txt	it 's five mile to our cottage 
113.txt	could n't walk five mile 
113.txt	i should like to see your cottage 
113.txt	she was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she saw it 
113.txt	it looked just a trifle like little susan ann 's when she wanted something very much
113.txt	i 'll ask my mother about it
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	she 's one o
113.txt	them that nearly always sees a way to do things  it 's my day out today an
113.txt	i 'm goin
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	i am glad 
113.txt	home  mrs medlock thinks a lot o
113.txt	perhaps she could talk to her 
113.txt	mother 
113.txt	i like your mother
113.txt	i should think tha
113.txt	did
113.txt	i 've never seen her
113.txt	no tha
113.txt	has n't
113.txt	she sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the back of her hand as if puzzled for a moment but she ended quite positively
113.txt	well she 's that sensible an
113.txt	hard workin
113.txt	an
113.txt	good natured an
113.txt	clean that no one could help likin
113.txt	her whether they 'd seen her or not  when i 'm goin
113.txt	home to her on my day out i just jump for joy when i 'm crossin
113.txt	the moor 
113.txt	i like dickon
113.txt	added mary 
113.txt	and i 've never seen him 
113.txt	well
113.txt	said martha stoutly
113.txt	i 've told thee that th
113.txt	very birds likes him an
113.txt	th
113.txt	rabbits an
113.txt	wild sheep an
113.txt	ponies an
113.txt	th
113.txt	foxes themselves  i wonder
113.txt	staring at her reflectively
113.txt	what dickon would think of thee ?
113.txt	he would n't like me
113.txt	said mary in her stiff cold little way 
113.txt	no one does
113.txt	how does tha
113.txt	like thysel
113.txt	?
113.txt	she inquired really quite as if she were curious to know
113.txt	mary hesitated a moment and thought it over
113.txt	not at all really
113.txt	she answered 
113.txt	but i never thought of that before
113.txt	mother said that to me once
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	she was at her wash tub an
113.txt	i was in a bad temper an
113.txt	talkin
113.txt	ill of folk an
113.txt	she turns round on me an
113.txt	says tha
113.txt	young vixen tha
113.txt	! there tha
113.txt	stands sayin
113.txt	tha
113.txt	does n't like this one an
113.txt	tha
113.txt	does n't like that one  how does tha
113.txt	like thysel
113.txt	?
113.txt	it made me laugh an
113.txt	it brought me to my senses in a minute 
113.txt	she was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do the week 's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly
113.txt	mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the house 
113.txt	she went out into the garden as quickly as possible and the first thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times 
113.txt	she counted the times carefully and when she had finished she felt in better spirits 
113.txt	the sunshine made the whole place look different 
113.txt	the high deep blue sky arched over misselthwaite as well as over the moor and she kept lifting her face and looking up into it trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of the little snow white clouds and float about 
113.txt	she went into the first kitchen garden and found ben weatherstaff working there with two other gardeners 
113.txt	the change in the weather seemed to have done him good 
113.txt	he spoke to her of his own accord
113.txt	springtime 's comin
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	can not tha
113.txt	smell it ?
113.txt	i smell something nice and fresh and damp
113.txt	that 's th
113.txt	good rich earth
113.txt	he answered digging away 
113.txt	it 's in a good humor makin
113.txt	ready to grow things  it 's glad when plantin
113.txt	time comes  it 's dull in th
113.txt	winter when it 's got nowt to do  in th
113.txt	flower gardens out there things will be stirrin
113.txt	down below in th
113.txt	dark  th
113.txt	sun 's warmin
113.txt	em  you 'll see bits o
113.txt	green spikes stickin
113.txt	out o
113.txt	th
113.txt	black earth after a bit 
113.txt	what will they be ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	crocuses an
113.txt	snowdrops an
113.txt	daffydowndillys  has tha
113.txt	never seen them ?
113.txt	no  everything is hot and wet and green after the rains in india
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	and i think things grow up in a night 
113.txt	these wo n't grow up in a night
113.txt	said weatherstaff 
113.txt	tha 'll have to wait for em  they 'll poke up a bit higher here an
113.txt	push out a spike more there an
113.txt	uncurl a leaf this day an
113.txt	you watch em 
113.txt	another that 
113.txt	i am going to
113.txt	very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knew at once that the robin had come again 
113.txt	he was very pert and lively and hopped about so close to her feet and put his head on one side and looked at her so slyly that she asked ben weatherstaff a question
113.txt	do you think he remembers me ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	remembers thee !
113.txt	said weatherstaff indignantly 
113.txt	he knows every cabbage stump in th
113.txt	gardens let alone th
113.txt	people  he 's never seen a little wench here before an
113.txt	he 's bent on findin
113.txt	tha 's no need to try to hide anything from him 
113.txt	are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he lives ?
113.txt	mary inquired
113.txt	what garden ?
113.txt	grunted weatherstaff becoming surly again
113.txt	the one where the old rose trees are
113.txt	she could not help asking because she wanted so much to know 
113.txt	are there ever any roses ?
113.txt	are all the flowers dead or do some of them come again in the summer ?
113.txt	ask him
113.txt	said ben weatherstaff hunching his shoulders toward the robin 
113.txt	he 's the only one as knows  no one else has seen inside it for ten year
113.txt	
113.txt	she had been born ten years ago
113.txt	she walked away slowly thinking 
113.txt	she had begun to like the garden just as she had begun to like the robin and dickon and martha 's mother 
113.txt	she was beginning to like martha too 
113.txt	that seemed a good many people to like when you were not used to liking 
113.txt	she thought of the robin as one of the people 
113.txt	she went to her walk outside the long ivy covered wall over which she could see the tree tops
113.txt	and the second time she walked up and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her and it was all through ben weatherstaff 's robin
113.txt	she heard a chirp and a twitter and when she looked at the bare flower bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending to peck things out of the earth to persuade her that he had not followed her 
113.txt	but she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled her with delight that she almost trembled a little
113.txt	you do remember me !
113.txt	she cried out 
113.txt	you are prettier than anything else in the world !
113.txt	you do !
113.txt	it was as if he were talking 
113.txt	his red waistcoat was like satin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important and like a human person a robin could be 
113.txt	mistress mary forgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer to him and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin sounds
113.txt	oh !
113.txt	to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as that !
113.txt	he knew nothing in the world would make her put out her hand toward him or startle him in the least tiniest way 
113.txt	he knew it because he was a real person only nicer than any other person in the world 
113.txt	she was so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe
113.txt	the flower bed was not quite bare 
113.txt	it was bare of flowers because the perennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest but there were tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed and as the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a small pile of freshly turned up earth 
113.txt	he stopped on it to look for a worm 
113.txt	the earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole
113.txt	mary looked at it not really knowing why the hole was there and as she looked she saw something almost buried in the newly turned soil 
113.txt	it was something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up
113.txt	it was more than a ring however
113.txt	it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time
113.txt	mistress mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her finger
113.txt	perhaps it has been buried for ten years
113.txt	perhaps it is the key to the garden !
113.txt	she turned it over and over and thought about it 
113.txt	as i have said before she was not a child who had been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things
113.txt	all she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden and she could find out where the door was she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the walls and what had happened to the old rose trees 
113.txt	it was because it had been shut up so long that she wanted to see it 
113.txt	it seemed as if it must be different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years 
113.txt	besides that if she liked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her and she could make up some play of her own and play it quite alone because nobody would ever know where she was but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth 
113.txt	the thought of that pleased her very much
113.txt	living as it were all by herself in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse herself had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening her imagination 
113.txt	there is no doubt that the fresh strong pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it 
113.txt	just as it had given her an appetite and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood so the same things had stirred her mind 
113.txt	in india she had always been too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything but in this place she was beginning to care and to want to do new things
113.txt	already she felt less
113.txt	contrary
113.txt	she put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk 
113.txt	no one but herself ever seemed to come there so she could walk slowly and look at the wall or rather at the ivy growing on it 
113.txt	the ivy was the baffling thing 
113.txt	howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but thickly growing glossy dark green leaves 
113.txt	she was very much disappointed 
113.txt	something of her contrariness came back to her as she paced the walk and looked over it at the tree tops inside 
113.txt	it seemed so silly she said to herself to be near it and not be able to get in
113.txt	she took the key in her pocket when she went back to the house and she made up her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went out so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be ready
113.txt	mrs medlock had allowed martha to sleep all night at the cottage but she was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever and in the best of spirits
113.txt	i got up at four oclock
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	eh ! it was pretty on th
113.txt	moor with th
113.txt	birds gettin
113.txt	up an
113.txt	th
113.txt	rabbits scamperin

113.txt	sun risin
113.txt	 i did n't walk all th
113.txt	way  a man gave me a ride in his cart an
113.txt	i did enjoy myself 
113.txt	her mother had been glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out of the way 
113.txt	she had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it
113.txt	i had em all pipin
113.txt	hot when they came in from playin
113.txt	on th
113.txt	an
113.txt	th
113.txt	cottage all smelt o
113.txt	nice clean hot bakin
113.txt	an
113.txt	there was a good fire an
113.txt	our dickon he said our cottage was good enough for a king to live in 
113.txt	they just shouted for joy 
113.txt	in the evening they had all sat round the fire and martha and her mother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and martha had told them about the little girl who had come from india and who had been waited on all her life by what martha called
113.txt	blacks
113.txt	eh ! they did like to hear about you
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	they wanted to know all about th
113.txt	blacks an
113.txt	about th
113.txt	i could n't tell em enough 
113.txt	ship you came in
113.txt	i 'll tell you a great deal more before your next day out
113.txt	she said
113.txt	i dare say they would like to hear about riding on elephants and camels and about the officers going to hunt tigers 
113.txt	so that you will have more to talk about 
113.txt	my word !
113.txt	cried delighted martha 
113.txt	it would set em clean off their heads  would tha
113.txt	it would be same as a wild beast show like we heard they had in york once 
113.txt	really do that miss ?
113.txt	india is quite different from yorkshire
113.txt	mary said slowly as she thought the matter over 
113.txt	did dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me ?
113.txt	i never thought of that 
113.txt	why our dickon 's eyes nearly started out o
113.txt	his head they got that round
113.txt	answered martha 
113.txt	but mother she was put out about your seemin
113.txt	she said has n't mr craven got no governess for her nor no nurse ?
113.txt	
113.txt	and i said no he has n't though mrs 
113.txt	medlock says he will when he thinks of it but she says he may n't think of it for two or three years 
113.txt	to be all by yourself like 
113.txt	i do n't want a governess
113.txt	but mother says you ought to be learnin
113.txt	your book by this time an
113.txt	you ought to have a woman to look after you an
113.txt	she says now martha you just think how you 'd feel yourself in a big place like that wanderin
113.txt	about all alone an
113.txt	no mother  you do your best to cheer her up
113.txt	she says an
113.txt	i said i would
113.txt	you do cheer me up
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i like to hear you talk
113.txt	what does tha
113.txt	think
113.txt	she said with a cheerful grin 
113.txt	i 've brought thee a present 
113.txt	a present !
113.txt	exclaimed mistress mary 
113.txt	how could a cottage full of fourteen hungry people give anyone a present !
113.txt	a man was drivin
113.txt	across the moor peddlin
113.txt	martha explained 
113.txt	an
113.txt	he stopped his cart at our door  he had pots an
113.txt	pans an
113.txt	odds an
113.txt	ends but mother had no money to buy anythin
113.txt	 just as he was goin
113.txt	away our lizabeth ellen called out mother he 's got skippinropes with red an
113.txt	blue handles
113.txt	an
113.txt	how much are they ?
113.txt	
113.txt	mother she calls out quite sudden here stop mister ! an
113.txt	he says tuppence
113.txt	an
113.txt	mother she began fumblin
113.txt	in her pocket an
113.txt	she says to me martha tha 's brought me thy wages like a good lass an
113.txt	i 've got four places to put every penny but i 'm just goin
113.txt	to take tuppence out of it to buy that child a skippinrope
113.txt	an
113.txt	she bought one an
113.txt	here it is
113.txt	it was a strong slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each end but mary lennox had never seen a skipping rope before 
113.txt	she gazed at it with a mystified expression
113.txt	what is it for ?
113.txt	she asked curiously
113.txt	for !
113.txt	cried out martha 
113.txt	does tha
113.txt	no wonder most of em 's black 
113.txt	this is what it 's for
113.txt	just watch me 
113.txt	mean that they 've not got skippinropes in india for all they 've got elephants and tigers and camels !
113.txt	but martha did not even see them 
113.txt	the interest and curiosity in mistress mary 's face delighted her and she went on skipping and counted as she skipped until she had reached a hundred
113.txt	i could skip longer than that
113.txt	she said when she stopped 
113.txt	i 've skipped as much as five hundred when i was twelve but i was n't as fat then as i am now an
113.txt	i was in practice
113.txt	it looks nice
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	do you think i could ever skip like that ?
113.txt	your mother is a kind woman 
113.txt	you just try it
113.txt	urged martha handing her the skipping rope
113.txt	that 's what mother said 
113.txt	she says nothin
113.txt	will do her more good than skippin
113.txt	rope  it 's th
113.txt	sensiblest toy a child can have  let her play out in th
113.txt	fresh air skippin
113.txt	an
113.txt	it 'll stretch her legs an
113.txt	arms an
113.txt	give her some strength in em 
113.txt	she was not very clever at it but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop
113.txt	put on tha
113.txt	things and run an
113.txt	skip out o
113.txt	doors
113.txt	mother said i must tell you to keep out o
113.txt	doors as much as you could even when it rains a bit so as tha
113.txt	wrap up warm
113.txt	she opened the door to go out and then suddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly
113.txt	martha
113.txt	she said
113.txt	it was your two pence really 
113.txt	they were your wages  thank you
113.txt	she said it stiffly because she was not used to thanking people or noticing that they did things for her 
113.txt	thank you
113.txt	martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake as if she was not accustomed to this sort of thing either 
113.txt	then she laughed
113.txt	eh ! th
113.txt	art a queer old womanish thing
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	if tha 'd been our lizabeth ellen tha 'd have given me a kiss
113.txt	do you want me to kiss you ?
113.txt	nay not me
113.txt	she answered 
113.txt	if tha
113.txt	was different praps tha 'd want to thysel
113.txt	 but tha
113.txt	is n't  run off outside an
113.txt	play with thy rope
113.txt	yorkshire people seemed strange and martha was always rather a puzzle to her 
113.txt	at first she had disliked her very much but now she did not
113.txt	the skipping rope was a wonderful thing 
113.txt	she counted and skipped and skipped and counted until her cheeks were quite red and she was more interested than she had ever been since she was born 
113.txt	the sun was shining and a little wind was blowing not a rough wind but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it 
113.txt	she skipped round the fountain garden and up one walk and down another 
113.txt	she skipped at last into the kitchen garden and saw ben weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin which was hopping about him 
113.txt	she skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his head and looked at her with a curious expression 
113.txt	she had wondered if he would notice her 
113.txt	she wanted him to see her skip
113.txt	well !
113.txt	he exclaimed 
113.txt	upon my word  praps tha
113.txt	art a young un after all an
113.txt	tha 's skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name 's ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	praps tha 's got child 's blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk  i would n't have believed tha
113.txt	could do it 
113.txt	i never skipped before
113.txt	mary said 
113.txt	i can only go up to twenty 
113.txt	i 'm just beginning 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	keep on
113.txt	said ben 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	shapes well enough at it for a young un that 's lived with heathen  just see how he 's watchin
113.txt	thee
113.txt	jerking his head toward the robin
113.txt	he 'll be at it again today 
113.txt	he 'll be bound to find out what th
113.txt	he 's never seen one 
113.txt	skippinrope is  eh !
113.txt	shaking his head at the bird
113.txt	tha
113.txt	curiosity will be th
113.txt	death of thee sometime if tha
113.txt	does n't look sharp 
113.txt	at length she went to her own special walk and made up her mind to try if she could skip the whole length of it 
113.txt	it was a good long skip and she began slowly but before she had gone half way down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop
113.txt	she did not mind much because she had already counted up to thirty
113.txt	she stopped with a little laugh of pleasure and there lo and behold was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy 
113.txt	he had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp 
113.txt	as mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump and when she saw the robin she laughed again
113.txt	you showed me where the key was yesterday
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	you ought to show me the door today
113.txt	but i do n't believe you know !
113.txt	nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows off and they are nearly always doing it
113.txt	mary lennox had heard a great deal about magic in her ayah 's stories and she always said that what happened almost at that moment was magic
113.txt	one of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk and it was a stronger one than the rest 
113.txt	it was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall 
113.txt	mary had stepped close to the robin and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand 
113.txt	this she did because she had seen something under it a round knob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it 
113.txt	it was the knob of a door
113.txt	she put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside 
113.txt	thick as the ivy hung it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain though some had crept over wood and iron 
113.txt	mary 's heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement
113.txt	the robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side as if he were as excited as she was 
113.txt	what was this under her hands which was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in ?
113.txt	it was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole 
113.txt	she put the key in and turned it 
113.txt	it took two hands to do it but it did turn
113.txt	and then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming 
113.txt	no one was coming 
113.txt	no one ever did come it seemed and she took another long breath because she could not help it and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly slowly
113.txt	then she slipped through it and shut it behind her and stood with her back against it looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement and wonder and delight
113.txt	she was standing inside the secret garden
113.txt	chapter ix the strangest house anyone ever lived in it was the sweetest most mysterious looking place anyone could imagine 
113.txt	the high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together 
113.txt	mary lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in india 
113.txt	all the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive 
113.txt	there were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees 
113.txt	there were other trees in the garden and one of the things which made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains and here and there they had caught at each other or at a far reaching branch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves 
113.txt	there were neither leaves nor roses on them now and mary did not know whether they were dead or alive but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything walls and trees and even brown grass where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground 
113.txt	it was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious 
113.txt	mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long
113.txt	and indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life
113.txt	how still it is !
113.txt	she whispered 
113.txt	how still !
113.txt	the robin who had flown to his treetop was still as all the rest 
113.txt	he did not even flutter his wings
113.txt	he sat without stirring and looked at mary
113.txt	no wonder it is still
113.txt	she whispered again 
113.txt	i am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years 
113.txt	she was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds 
113.txt	she walked under one of the fairy like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them
113.txt	i wonder if they are all quite dead
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i wish it was n't 
113.txt	is it all a quite dead garden ?
113.txt	but she was inside the wonderful garden and she could come through the door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a world all her own
113.txt	the sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over the moor 
113.txt	the robin flew down from his tree top and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another
113.txt	he chirped a good deal and had a very busy air as if he were showing her things 
113.txt	everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from anyone but somehow she did not feel lonely at all 
113.txt	all that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all the roses were dead or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer 
113.txt	she did not want it to be a quite dead garden 
113.txt	if it were a quite alive garden how wonderful it would be and what thousands of roses would grow on every side !
113.txt	her skipping rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she had walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole garden stopping when she wanted to look at things 
113.txt	there seemed to have been grass paths here and there and in one or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss covered flower urns in them
113.txt	as she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping
113.txt	there had once been a flowerbed in it and she thought she saw something sticking out of the black earth some sharp little pale green points 
113.txt	she remembered what ben weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look at them
113.txt	yes they are tiny growing things and they might be crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils
113.txt	she bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp earth 
113.txt	she liked it very much
113.txt	perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i will go all over the garden and look 
113.txt	she went slowly and kept her eyes on the ground 
113.txt	she looked in the old border beds and among the grass and after she had gone round trying to miss nothing she had found ever so many more sharp pale green points and she had become quite excited again
113.txt	it is n't a quite dead garden
113.txt	she cried out softly to herself 
113.txt	even if the roses are dead there are other things alive 
113.txt	she searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she made nice little clear places around them
113.txt	now they look as if they could breathe
113.txt	she said after she had finished with the first ones 
113.txt	i 'll do all i can see 
113.txt	if i have n't time today i can come tomorrow 
113.txt	i am going to do ever so many more 
113.txt	the exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat off and then her hat and without knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points all the time
113.txt	the robin was tremendously busy 
113.txt	he was very much pleased to see gardening begun on his own estate 
113.txt	he had often wondered at ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with the soil 
113.txt	now here was this new kind of creature who was not half ben 's size and yet had had the sense to come into his garden and begin at once
113.txt	mistress mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her midday dinner 
113.txt	in fact she was rather late in remembering and when she put on her coat and hat and picked up her skipping rope she could not believe that she had been working two or three hours 
113.txt	she had been actually happy all the time
113.txt	and dozens and dozens of the tiny pale green points were to be seen in cleared places looking twice as cheerful as they had looked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them
113.txt	i shall come back this afternoon
113.txt	then she ran lightly across the grass pushed open the slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy 
113.txt	she had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such a dinner that martha was delighted
113.txt	two pieces o
113.txt	meat an
113.txt	two helps o
113.txt	rice puddin
113.txt	!
113.txt	she said
113.txt	mother will be pleased when i tell her what th
113.txt	skippinrope 's done for thee 
113.txt	she had put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she wondered if martha could tell her what it was
113.txt	martha
113.txt	she said
113.txt	what are those white roots that look like onions ?
113.txt	they 're bulbs
113.txt	answered martha 
113.txt	lots o
113.txt	spring flowers grow from em  th
113.txt	very little ones are snowdrops an
113.txt	crocuses an
113.txt	th
113.txt	big ones are narcissuses an
113.txt	jonquils and daffydowndillys  th
113.txt	biggest of all is lilies an
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	they are nice 
113.txt	purple flags  dickon 's got a whole lot of em planted in our bit o
113.txt	garden 
113.txt	does dickon know all about them ?
113.txt	asked mary a new idea taking possession of her
113.txt	our dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk  mother says he just whispers things out o
113.txt	th
113.txt	ground 
113.txt	do bulbs live a long time ? would they live years and years if no one helped them ?
113.txt	inquired mary anxiously
113.txt	they 're things as helps themselves
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	that 's why poor folk can afford to have em  if you do n't trouble em most of em 'll work away underground for a lifetime an
113.txt	spread out an
113.txt	have little uns  there 's a place in th
113.txt	park woods here where there 's snowdrops by thousands  they 're the prettiest sight in yorkshire when th
113.txt	no one knows when they was first planted 
113.txt	spring comes 
113.txt	i wish the spring was here now
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i want to see all the things that grow in england
113.txt	i wish i wish i had a little spade
113.txt	whatever does tha
113.txt	want a spade for ?
113.txt	asked martha laughing 
113.txt	art tha
113.txt	goin
113.txt	to take to diggin
113.txt	i must tell mother that too 
113.txt	?
113.txt	she must be careful if she meant to keep her secret kingdom 
113.txt	she was n't doing any harm but if mr 
113.txt	craven found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry and get a new key and lock it up forevermore 
113.txt	she really could not bear that
113.txt	this is such a big lonely place
113.txt	she said slowly as if she were turning matters over in her mind 
113.txt	so many places seem shut up 
113.txt	i never did many things in india but there were more people to look at natives and soldiers marching by and sometimes bands playing and my ayah told me stories 
113.txt	there is no one to talk to here except you and ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	and you have to do your work and ben weatherstaff wo n't speak to me often 
113.txt	i thought if i had a little spade i could dig somewhere as he does and i might make a little garden if he would give me some seeds 
113.txt	the house is lonely and the park is lonely and the gardens are lonely
113.txt	there now !
113.txt	she exclaimed
113.txt	if that was n't one of th
113.txt	things mother said  she says there 's such a lot o
113.txt	room in that big place why do n't they give her a bit for herself even if she does n't plant nothin
113.txt	but parsley an
113.txt	radishes ? she 'd dig an
113.txt	rake away an
113.txt	them was the very words she said 
113.txt	be right down happy over it
113.txt	were they ?
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	how many things she knows does n't she ?
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	it 's like she says
113.txt	a woman as brings up twelve children learns something besides her a b c children 's as good as rithmetic to set you findin
113.txt	out things 
113.txt	how much would a spade cost a little one ?
113.txt	mary asked
113.txt	well
113.txt	was martha 's reflective answer
113.txt	at thwaite village there 's a shop or so an
113.txt	i saw little garden sets with a spade an
113.txt	a rake an
113.txt	a fork all tied together for two shillings  an
113.txt	they was stout enough to work with too 
113.txt	i 've got more than that in my purse
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	craven 
113.txt	mrs morrison gave me five shillings and mrs medlock gave me some money from mr 
113.txt	did he remember thee that much ?
113.txt	exclaimed martha
113.txt	she gives me one every saturday 
113.txt	i did n't know what to spend it on 
113.txt	mrs medlock said i was to have a shilling a week to spend 
113.txt	my word ! that 's riches
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	can buy anything in th
113.txt	world tha
113.txt	wants  th
113.txt	rent of our cottage is only one an
113.txt	threepence an
113.txt	it 's like pullin
113.txt	eye teeth to get it  now i 've just thought of somethin
113.txt	what ?
113.txt	said mary eagerly
113.txt	in the shop at thwaite they sell packages o
113.txt	flower seeds for a penny each and our dickon he knows which is th
113.txt	prettiest ones an
113.txt	how to make em grow  he walks over to thwaite many a day just for th
113.txt	fun of it  does tha
113.txt	know how to print letters ?
113.txt	suddenly
113.txt	i know how to write
113.txt	martha shook her head
113.txt	our dickon can only read printin
113.txt	 if tha
113.txt	could print we could write a letter to him an
113.txt	ask him to go an
113.txt	buy th
113.txt	garden tools an
113.txt	th
113.txt	seeds at th
113.txt	same time
113.txt	oh ! you 're a good girl !
113.txt	mary cried 
113.txt	i did n't know you were so nice 
113.txt	i know i can print letters if i try 
113.txt	let 's ask mrs
113.txt	medlock for a pen and ink and some paper 
113.txt	i 've got some of my own
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	i 'll go and get it 
113.txt	i bought em so i could print a bit of a letter to mother of a sunday
113.txt	if i have a spade
113.txt	she whispered
113.txt	if i have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden wo n't be dead at all it will come alive 
113.txt	i can make the earth nice and soft and dig up weeds 
113.txt	then it was a serious piece of work to write to dickon 
113.txt	mary had been taught very little because her governesses had disliked her too much to stay with her 
113.txt	she could not spell particularly well but she found that she could print letters when she tried 
113.txt	she did not go out again that afternoon because when martha returned with her pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table and carry the plates and dishes downstairs and when she got into the kitchen mrs medlock was there and told her to do something so mary waited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back  this was the letter martha dictated to her
113.txt	miss mary has plenty of money and will you go to thwaite and buy her some flower seeds and a set of garden tools to make a flower bed 
113.txt	pick the prettiest ones and easy to grow because she has never done it before and lived in india which is different 
113.txt	give my love to mother and everyone of you 
113.txt	miss mary is going to tell me a lot more so that on my next day out you can hear about elephants and camels and gentlemen going hunting lions and tigers
113.txt	your loving sister
113.txt	martha phoebe sowerby 
113.txt	we 'll put the money in th
113.txt	envelope an
113.txt	i 'll get th
113.txt	butcher boy to take it in his cart  he 's a great friend o
113.txt	dickon 's
113.txt	how shall i get the things when dickon buys them ?
113.txt	he 'll bring em to you himself  he 'll like to walk over this way
113.txt	oh !
113.txt	exclaimed mary
113.txt	i never thought i should see dickon 
113.txt	then i shall see him !
113.txt	does tha
113.txt	want to see him ?
113.txt	asked martha suddenly for mary had looked so pleased
113.txt	i never saw a boy foxes and crows loved 
113.txt	i want to see him very much 
113.txt	yes i do
113.txt	now to think
113.txt	she broke out
113.txt	to think o
113.txt	me forgettin
113.txt	that there
113.txt	an
113.txt	i thought i was goin
113.txt	to tell you first thing this mornin
113.txt	i asked mother and she said she 'd ask mrs medlock her own self 
113.txt	
113.txt	do you mean
113.txt	what i said tuesday  ask her if you might be driven over to our cottage some day and have a bit o
113.txt	mother 's hot oat cake an
113.txt	butter an
113.txt	a glass o
113.txt	milk
113.txt	to think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue !
113.txt	to think of going into the cottage which held twelve children !
113.txt	does she think mrs medlock would let me go ?
113.txt	she asked quite anxiously
113.txt	she knows what a tidy woman mother is and how clean she keeps the cottage 
113.txt	aye she thinks she would 
113.txt	if i went i should see your mother as well as dickon
113.txt	said mary thinking it over and liking the idea very much 
113.txt	she does n't seem to be like the mothers in india 
113.txt	martha stayed with her until tea time but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little 
113.txt	but just before martha went downstairs for the tea tray mary asked a question
113.txt	martha
113.txt	she said
113.txt	has the scullery maid had the toothache again today ?
113.txt	what makes thee ask that ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	and i heard that far off crying again just as we heard it the other night 
113.txt	because when i waited so long for you to come back i opened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you were coming  there is n't a wind today so you see it could n't have been the wind
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	said martha restlessly 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	must n't go walkin
113.txt	about in corridors an
113.txt	listenin
113.txt	 mr craven would be that there angry there 's no knowin
113.txt	what he 'd do 
113.txt	i was n't listening
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	that 's three times 
113.txt	i was just waiting for you and i heard it 
113.txt	my word ! there 's mrs medlock 's bell
113.txt	it 's the strangest house anyone ever lived in
113.txt	fresh air and digging and skipping rope had made her feel so comfortably tired that she fell asleep
113.txt	chapter x dickon the sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden 
113.txt	the secret garden was what mary called it when she was thinking of it 
113.txt	she liked the name and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in no one knew where she was 
113.txt	it seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place 
113.txt	the few books she had read and liked had been fairy story books and she had read of secret gardens in some of the stories 
113.txt	sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years which she had thought must be rather stupid 
113.txt	she had no intention of going to sleep and in fact she was becoming wider awake every day which passed at misselthwaite 
113.txt	she was beginning to like to be out of doors
113.txt	she no longer hated the wind but enjoyed it 
113.txt	she could run faster and longer and she could skip up to a hundred 
113.txt	the bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished
113.txt	such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted and really if mistress mary had known it they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously 
113.txt	the sun could get at them and warm them and when the rain came down it could reach them at once so they began to feel very much alive
113.txt	mary was an odd determined little person and now she had something interesting to be determined about she was very much absorbed indeed
113.txt	she worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it 
113.txt	it seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play 
113.txt	she found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find 
113.txt	they seemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny new ones some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth
113.txt	there were so many that she remembered what martha had said about the
113.txt	snowdrops by the thousands
113.txt	these had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread like the snowdrops into thousands 
113.txt	she wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers 
113.txt	sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom
113.txt	during that week of sunshine she became more intimate with ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	she surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth 
113.txt	the truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming so she always walked toward him as silently as possible 
113.txt	but in fact he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first
113.txt	perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company 
113.txt	then also she was more civil than she had been 
113.txt	he did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a native and had not known that a cross sturdy old yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters and be merely commanded by them to do things
113.txt	thart like th
113.txt	robin
113.txt	he said to her one morning when he lifted his head and saw her standing by him 
113.txt	i never knows when i shall see thee or which side tha 'll come from 
113.txt	he 's friends with me now
113.txt	that 's like him
113.txt	snapped ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	makin
113.txt	up to th
113.txt	women folk just for vanity an
113.txt	flightiness  there 's nothin
113.txt	he would n't do for th
113.txt	sake o

113.txt	his tail feathers  he 's as full o
113.txt	pride as an egg 's full o
113.txt	meat
113.txt	he stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while he looked her over
113.txt	how long has tha
113.txt	been here ?
113.txt	he jerked out
113.txt	i think it 's about a month
113.txt	tha 's beginnin
113.txt	to do misselthwaite credit
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	tha 's a bit fatter than tha
113.txt	was an
113.txt	tha 's not quite so yeller  tha
113.txt	looked like a young plucked crow when tha
113.txt	thinks i to myself i never set eyes on an uglier sourer faced young un 
113.txt	first came into this garden
113.txt	i know i 'm fatter
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	they used to make wrinkles 
113.txt	there 's the robin ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	my stockings are getting tighter 
113.txt	his red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces 
113.txt	he seemed determined to make ben weatherstaff admire him 
113.txt	but ben was sarcastic
113.txt	aye there tha
113.txt	art !
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	can put up with me for a bit sometimes when tha 's got no one better  tha 's been reddenin

113.txt	ready to fight all th
113.txt	rest of em
113.txt	oh ! look at him !
113.txt	exclaimed mary
113.txt	the robin was evidently in a fascinating bold mood 
113.txt	he hopped closer and closer and looked at ben weatherstaff more and more engagingly 
113.txt	he flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a little song right at him
113.txt	tha
113.txt	thinks tha 'll get over me by doin
113.txt	that
113.txt	said ben wrinkling his face up in such a way that mary felt sure he was trying not to look pleased 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	thinks no one can stand out against thee that 's what tha
113.txt	thinks 
113.txt	he flew right up to the handle of ben weatherstaff 's spade and alighted on the top of it 
113.txt	then the old man 's face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression 
113.txt	he stood still as if he were afraid to breathe as if he would not have stirred for the world lest his robin should start away
113.txt	he spoke quite in a whisper
113.txt	well i 'm danged !
113.txt	he said as softly as if he were saying something quite different 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	does know how to get at a chap tha
113.txt	does ! tha 's fair unearthly tha 's so knowin
113.txt	
113.txt	then he stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be magic in it and then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes
113.txt	but because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then mary was not afraid to talk to him
113.txt	have you a garden of your own ?
113.txt	she asked
113.txt	no  i 'm bachelder an
113.txt	lodge with martin at th
113.txt	gate 
113.txt	if you had one
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	what would you plant ?
113.txt	cabbages an
113.txt	taters an
113.txt	onions 
113.txt	but if you wanted to make a flower garden
113.txt	persisted mary
113.txt	what would you plant ?
113.txt	bulbs an
113.txt	sweet smellin
113.txt	things but mostly roses
113.txt	do you like roses ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	ben weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered
113.txt	i was learned that by a young lady i was gardener to
113.txt	she had a lot in a place she was fond of an
113.txt	she loved em like they was children or robins  i 've seen her bend over an
113.txt	kiss em
113.txt	he dragged out another weed and scowled at it 
113.txt	that were as much as ten year
113.txt	ago 
113.txt	where is she now ?
113.txt	asked mary much interested
113.txt	heaven
113.txt	he answered and drove his spade deep into the soil
113.txt	cording to what parson says 
113.txt	what happened to the roses ?
113.txt	mary asked again more interested than ever
113.txt	they was left to themselves
113.txt	did they quite die ? do roses quite die when they are left to themselves ?
113.txt	she ventured
113.txt	well i 'd got to like em an
113.txt	i liked her an
113.txt	she liked em
113.txt	ben weatherstaff admitted reluctantly 
113.txt	once or twice a year i 'd go an
113.txt	work at em a bit prune em an
113.txt	dig about th
113.txt	they run wild but they was in rich soil so some of em lived 
113.txt	roots 
113.txt	when they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry how can you tell whether they are dead or alive ?
113.txt	inquired mary
113.txt	wait till th
113.txt	spring gets at em wait till th
113.txt	sun shines on th
113.txt	rain and th
113.txt	rain falls on th
113.txt	sunshine an
113.txt	then tha 'll find out
113.txt	how how ?
113.txt	cried mary forgetting to be careful
113.txt	look along th
113.txt	twigs an
113.txt	branches an
113.txt	if tha
113.txt	see a bit of a brown lump swelling here an
113.txt	there watch it after th
113.txt	warm rain an
113.txt	see what happens
113.txt	he stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face
113.txt	why does tha
113.txt	care so much about roses an
113.txt	such all of a sudden ?
113.txt	he demanded
113.txt	mistress mary felt her face grow red 
113.txt	she was almost afraid to answer
113.txt	i i want to play that that i have a garden of my own
113.txt	i have nothing and no one 
113.txt	i there is nothing for me to do 
113.txt	well
113.txt	said ben weatherstaff slowly as he watched her
113.txt	tha
113.txt	has n't 
113.txt	she had never felt sorry for herself
113.txt	she had only felt tired and cross because she disliked people and things so much 
113.txt	but now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer 
113.txt	if no one found out about the secret garden she should enjoy herself always
113.txt	she stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many questions as she dared 
113.txt	he answered everyone of them in his queer grunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his spade and leave her 
113.txt	he said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond of
113.txt	do you go and see those other roses now ?
113.txt	she asked
113.txt	not been this year  my rheumatics has made me too stiff in th
113.txt	joints
113.txt	now look here !
113.txt	he said sharply 
113.txt	do n't tha
113.txt	thart th
113.txt	worst wench for askin
113.txt	questions i 've ever come across  get thee gone an
113.txt	play thee  i 've done talkin
113.txt	for today 
113.txt	she went skipping slowly down the outside walk thinking him over and saying to herself that queer as it was here was another person whom she liked in spite of his crossness 
113.txt	she liked old ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	yes she did like him 
113.txt	she always wanted to try to make him talk to her 
113.txt	also she began to believe that he knew everything in the world about flowers
113.txt	there was a laurel hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood in the park 
113.txt	she thought she would slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about 
113.txt	she enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was
113.txt	it was a very strange thing indeed 
113.txt	she quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it 
113.txt	a boy was sitting under a tree with his back against it playing on a rough wooden pipe 
113.txt	he was a funny looking boy about twelve 
113.txt	he looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had mistress mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy 's face 
113.txt	and on the trunk of the tree he leaned against a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipe seemed to make
113.txt	when he saw mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost as low as and rather like his piping
113.txt	do n't tha
113.txt	move
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	it 'd flight em 
113.txt	he stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the ground 
113.txt	he moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were moving at all but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree the pheasant withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away though not at all as if they were frightened
113.txt	i 'm dickon
113.txt	the boy said 
113.txt	i know thart miss mary 
113.txt	who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in india ?
113.txt	he had a wide red curving mouth and his smile spread all over his face
113.txt	i got up slow
113.txt	he explained
113.txt	because if tha
113.txt	makes a quick move it startles em  a body as to move gentle an
113.txt	speak low when wild things is about 
113.txt	mary knew nothing about boys and she spoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy
113.txt	did you get martha 's letter ?
113.txt	she asked
113.txt	he nodded his curly rust colored head
113.txt	that 's why i come
113.txt	i 've got th
113.txt	garden tools  there 's a little spade an
113.txt	rake an
113.txt	a fork an
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	they are good uns 
113.txt	there 's a trowel too 
113.txt	hoe  an
113.txt	th
113.txt	woman in th
113.txt	shop threw in a packet o
113.txt	white poppy an
113.txt	one o
113.txt	blue larkspur when i bought th
113.txt	other seeds 
113.txt	will you show the seeds to me ?
113.txt	mary said
113.txt	she wished she could talk as he did 
113.txt	his speech was so quick and easy
113.txt	it sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not like him though he was only a common moor boy in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough rusty red head 
113.txt	as she came closer to him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him almost as if he were made of them 
113.txt	she liked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy
113.txt	let us sit down on this log and look at them
113.txt	they sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his coat pocket 
113.txt	he untied the string and inside there were ever so many neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one
113.txt	there 's a lot o
113.txt	mignonette an
113.txt	poppies
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	mignonette 's th
113.txt	sweetest smellin
113.txt	thing as grows an
113.txt	it 'll grow wherever you cast it same as poppies will  them as 'll come up an
113.txt	bloom if you just whistle to em them 's th
113.txt	nicest of all
113.txt	where 's that robin as is callin
113.txt	us ?
113.txt	he said
113.txt	the chirp came from a thick holly bush bright with scarlet berries and mary thought she knew whose it was
113.txt	is it really calling us ?
113.txt	she asked
113.txt	aye
113.txt	said dickon as if it was the most natural thing in the world
113.txt	he 's callin
113.txt	someone he 's friends with  that 's same as sayin
113.txt	look at me 
113.txt	i wants a bit of a chat
113.txt	
113.txt	there he is in the bush
113.txt	whose is he ?
113.txt	he 's ben weatherstaff 's but i think he knows me a little
113.txt	aye he knows thee
113.txt	said dickon in his low voice again 
113.txt	an
113.txt	he 's took thee on 
113.txt	he 'll tell me all about thee in a minute 
113.txt	he likes thee 
113.txt	the robin listened a few seconds intently and then answered quite as if he were replying to a question
113.txt	aye he 's a friend o
113.txt	yours
113.txt	do you think he is ?
113.txt	cried mary eagerly 
113.txt	she did so want to know 
113.txt	do you think he really likes me ?
113.txt	he would n't come near thee if he did n't
113.txt	answered dickon 
113.txt	birds is rare choosers an
113.txt	see he 's making up to thee now 
113.txt	a robin can flout a body worse than a man  can not tha
113.txt	see a chap ?
113.txt	he 's sayin
113.txt	
113.txt	he so sidled and twittered and tilted as he hopped on his bush
113.txt	do you understand everything birds say ?
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	dickon 's grin spread until he seemed all wide red curving mouth and he rubbed his rough head
113.txt	i think i do and they think i do
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i 've lived on th
113.txt	moor with em so long  i 've watched em break shell an
113.txt	come out an
113.txt	fledge an
113.txt	learn to fly an
113.txt	sometimes i think praps i 'm a bird or a fox or a rabbit or a squirrel or even a beetle an
113.txt	i do n't know it 
113.txt	he told her what they looked like when they were flowers
113.txt	he told her how to plant them and watch them and feed and water them
113.txt	see here
113.txt	he said suddenly turning round to look at her 
113.txt	i 'll plant them for thee myself  where is tha
113.txt	garden ?
113.txt	she did not know what to say so for a whole minute she said nothing 
113.txt	she had never thought of this 
113.txt	she felt miserable 
113.txt	and she felt as if she went red and then pale
113.txt	tha 's got a bit o
113.txt	garden has n't tha
113.txt	?
113.txt	dickon said
113.txt	it was true that she had turned red and then pale 
113.txt	dickon saw her do it and as she still said nothing he began to be puzzled
113.txt	would n't they give thee a bit ?
113.txt	he asked 
113.txt	has n't tha
113.txt	got any yet ?
113.txt	i do n't know anything about boys
113.txt	she said slowly 
113.txt	it 's a great secret 
113.txt	i do n't know what i should do if anyone found it out 
113.txt	could you keep a secret if i told you one ? i believe i should die !
113.txt	she said the last sentence quite fiercely
113.txt	dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his rough head again but he answered quite good humoredly
113.txt	i 'm keepin
113.txt	secrets all th
113.txt	time
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	if i could n't keep secrets from th
113.txt	other lads secrets about foxes
113.txt	cubs an
113.txt	birds
113.txt	nests an

113.txt	holes there 'd be naught safe on th
113.txt	aye i can keep secrets 
113.txt	moor
113.txt	i 've stolen a garden
113.txt	she said very fast 
113.txt	it is n't anybody 's 
113.txt	nobody wants it nobody cares for it nobody ever goes into it 
113.txt	perhaps everything is dead in it already 
113.txt	i do n't know 
113.txt	it is n't mine
113.txt	nobody has any right to take it from me when i care about it and they do n't 
113.txt	i do n't care i do n't care ! they 're letting it die all shut in by itself
113.txt	dickon 's curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder
113.txt	eh h h !
113.txt	he said drawing his exclamation out slowly and the way he did it meant both wonder and sympathy
113.txt	i 've nothing to do
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i found it myself and i got into it myself 
113.txt	i was only just like the robin and they would n't take it from the robin 
113.txt	nothing belongs to me 
113.txt	where is it ?
113.txt	asked dickon in a dropped voice
113.txt	mistress mary got up from the log at once 
113.txt	she knew she felt contrary again and obstinate and she did not care at all 
113.txt	she was imperious and indian and at the same time hot and sorrowful
113.txt	come with me and i 'll show you
113.txt	she led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so thickly 
113.txt	dickon followed her with a queer almost pitying look on his face 
113.txt	he felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird 's nest and must move softly 
113.txt	when she stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he started 
113.txt	there was a door and mary pushed it slowly open and they passed in together and then mary stood and waved her hand round defiantly
113.txt	it 's this
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	it 's a secret garden and i 'm the only one in the world who wants it to be alive
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	he almost whispered
113.txt	it 's like as if a body was in a dream 
113.txt	it is a queer pretty place !
113.txt	his eyes seemed to be taking in everything the gray trees with the gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches the tangle on the walls and among the grass the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall flower urns standing in them
113.txt	i never thought i 'd see this place
113.txt	did you know about it ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	she had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her
113.txt	we must talk low
113.txt	he said
113.txt	or someone 'll hear us an
113.txt	wonder what 's to do in here
113.txt	oh ! i forgot !
113.txt	said mary feeling frightened and putting her hand quickly against her mouth 
113.txt	did you know about the garden ?
113.txt	she asked again when she had recovered herself
113.txt	dickon nodded
113.txt	martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside
113.txt	us used to wonder what it was like
113.txt	eh ! the nests as 'll be here come springtime
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	it 'd be th
113.txt	safest nestin
113.txt	place in england  no one never comin
113.txt	near an
113.txt	tangles o
113.txt	trees an
113.txt	roses to build in  i wonder all th
113.txt	birds on th
113.txt	moor do n't build here
113.txt	will there be roses ?
113.txt	she whispered 
113.txt	can you tell ? i thought perhaps they were all dead
113.txt	no !
113.txt	eh ! not them not all of em !
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	look here !
113.txt	he took a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of its blades
113.txt	there 's lots o
113.txt	dead wood as ought to be cut out
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	an
113.txt	there 's a lot o
113.txt	old wood but it made some new last year  this here 's a new bit
113.txt	mary touched it herself in an eager reverent way
113.txt	that one ?
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	is that one quite alive quite ?
113.txt	it 's as wick as you or me
113.txt	he said
113.txt	and mary remembered that martha had told her that
113.txt	wick
113.txt	meant
113.txt	alive
113.txt	or
113.txt	lively 
113.txt	i 'm glad it 's wick !
113.txt	she cried out in her whisper 
113.txt	let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there are 
113.txt	i want them all to be wick
113.txt	they went from tree to tree and from bush to bush 
113.txt	dickon carried his knife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful
113.txt	they 've run wild
113.txt	he said
113.txt	but th
113.txt	strongest ones has fair thrived on it  the delicatest ones has died out but th
113.txt	others has growed an
113.txt	growed an
113.txt	spread an
113.txt	spread till they 's a wonder  see here !
113.txt	and he pulled down a thick gray dry looking branch 
113.txt	a body might think this was dead wood but i do n't believe it is down to th
113.txt	root  i 'll cut it low down an
113.txt	see
113.txt	there !
113.txt	he said exultantly 
113.txt	there 's green in that wood yet 
113.txt	look at it 
113.txt	i told thee so
113.txt	when it looks a bit greenish an
113.txt	juicy like that it 's wick
113.txt	he explained 
113.txt	when th
113.txt	inside is dry an
113.txt	breaks easy like this here piece i 've cut off it 's done for  there 's a big root here as all this live wood sprung out of an
113.txt	if th
113.txt	old wood 's cut off an
113.txt	it 's dug round and took care of there 'll be
113.txt	he stopped and lifted his face to look up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him
113.txt	there 'll be a fountain o
113.txt	roses here this summer 
113.txt	he was very strong and clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood away and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it 
113.txt	in the course of half an hour mary thought she could tell too and when he cut through a lifeless looking branch she would cry out joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade of moist green 
113.txt	the spade and hoe and fork were very useful 
113.txt	he showed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in
113.txt	they were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses when he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation of surprise
113.txt	why !
113.txt	he cried pointing to the grass a few feet away 
113.txt	who did that there ?
113.txt	i did it
113.txt	why i thought tha
113.txt	did n't know nothin
113.txt	about gardenin
113.txt	i do n't
113.txt	she answered
113.txt	so i made a place for them 
113.txt	i do n't even know what they are 
113.txt	but they were so little and the grass was so thick and strong and they looked as if they had no room to breathe
113.txt	tha
113.txt	was right
113.txt	he said
113.txt	they 'll grow now like jack 's bean stalk 
113.txt	they 're crocuses an
113.txt	snowdrops an
113.txt	these here is narcissuses

113.txt	i like to smell the earth when it 's turned up 
113.txt	and i 'm growing stronger 
113.txt	it 's rare good for thee
113.txt	he said nodding his head wisely 
113.txt	there 's naught as nice as th
113.txt	smell o
113.txt	good clean earth except th
113.txt	smell o
113.txt	fresh growin

113.txt	my nose end fair quivers like a rabbit 's mother says 
113.txt	sniff

113.txt	inquired mary gazing at him wonderingly
113.txt	she had never seen such a funny boy or such a nice one
113.txt	not me
113.txt	he said grinning 
113.txt	i was n't brought up nesh enough 
113.txt	i never ketched cold since i was born  i 've chased about th
113.txt	moor in all weathers same as th

113.txt	i 'm as tough as a white thorn knobstick 
113.txt	with cold
113.txt	there 's a lot of work to do here !
113.txt	he said once looking about quite exultantly
113.txt	will you come again and help me to do it ?
113.txt	mary begged 
113.txt	i can dig and pull up weeds and do whatever you tell me 
113.txt	oh !
113.txt	do come dickon !
113.txt	i 'm sure i can help too 
113.txt	i 'll come every day if tha
113.txt	wants me rain or shine
113.txt	he answered stoutly 
113.txt	it 's the best fun i ever had in my life shut in here an
113.txt	wakenin
113.txt	up a garden 
113.txt	if you will come
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	if you will help me to make it alive i 'll i do n't know what i 'll do
113.txt	what could you do for a boy like that ?
113.txt	i 'll tell thee what tha 'll do

113.txt	tha 'll get as hungry as a young fox an
113.txt	tha 'll learn how to talk to th
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	robin same as i do  we 'll have a lot o
113.txt	fun
113.txt	i would n't want to make it look like a gardener 's garden all clipped an
113.txt	spick an
113.txt	span would you ?
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	it 's nicer like this with things runnin
113.txt	wild an
113.txt	swingin
113.txt	an
113.txt	catchin
113.txt	hold of each other 
113.txt	do n't let us make it tidy
113.txt	said mary anxiously 
113.txt	it would n't seem like a secret garden if it was tidy
113.txt	it 's a secret garden sure enough
113.txt	he said
113.txt	but seems like someone besides th
113.txt	robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year
113.txt	ago 
113.txt	but the door was locked and the key was buried
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	no one could get in 
113.txt	that 's true
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	it 's a queer place  seems to me as if there 'd been a bit o
113.txt	prunin
113.txt	done here an
113.txt	there later than ten year
113.txt	ago 
113.txt	but how could it have been done ?
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	he was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head
113.txt	aye ! how could it !
113.txt	he murmured 
113.txt	with th
113.txt	door locked an
113.txt	th
113.txt	key buried 
113.txt	of course it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning 
113.txt	when dickon began to clear places to plant seeds she remembered what basil had sung at her when he wanted to tease her
113.txt	are there any flowers that look like bells ?
113.txt	she inquired
113.txt	lilies o
113.txt	th
113.txt	valley does
113.txt	he answered digging away with the trowel
113.txt	an
113.txt	there 's canterbury bells an
113.txt	campanulas 
113.txt	let 's plant some
113.txt	there 's lilies o
113.txt	th valley here already
113.txt	i saw em  they 'll have growed too close an
113.txt	th
113.txt	other ones takes two years to bloom from seed but i can bring you some bits o
113.txt	plants from our cottage garden  why does tha
113.txt	want em ?
113.txt	then mary told him about basil and his brothers and sisters in india and of how she had hated them and of their calling her
113.txt	mistress mary quite contrary 
113.txt	they sang mistress mary quite contrary how does your garden grow ?
113.txt	with silver bells and cockle shells and marigolds all in a row 
113.txt	i just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers like silver bells
113.txt	i was n't as contrary as they were
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	he said and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he was sniffing up the scent of it 
113.txt	there does n't seem to be no need for no one to be contrary when there 's flowers an
113.txt	such like an
113.txt	such lots o
113.txt	friendly wild things runnin
113.txt	about makin
113.txt	homes for themselves or buildin
113.txt	nests an
113.txt	singin
113.txt	an
113.txt	whistlin
113.txt	does there ?
113.txt	dickon
113.txt	she said
113.txt	i like you and you make the fifth person 
113.txt	i never thought i should like five people 
113.txt	you are as nice as martha said you were 
113.txt	he did look funny and delightful mary thought with his round blue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned up nose
113.txt	only five folk as tha
113.txt	likes ?
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	who is th
113.txt	other four ?
113.txt	your mother and martha
113.txt	mary checked them off on her fingers
113.txt	and the robin and ben weatherstaff
113.txt	i know tha
113.txt	thinks i 'm a queer lad
113.txt	he said
113.txt	but i think tha
113.txt	art th
113.txt	queerest little lass i ever saw 
113.txt	she leaned forward and asked him a question she had never dreamed of asking anyone before 
113.txt	and she tried to ask it in yorkshire because that was his language and in india a native was always pleased if you knew his speech
113.txt	does tha
113.txt	like me ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	he answered heartily
113.txt	that i does  i likes thee wonderful an
113.txt	so does th
113.txt	robin i do believe !
113.txt	that 's two then
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	that 's two for me 
113.txt	mary was startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the hour of her midday dinner
113.txt	i shall have to go
113.txt	she said mournfully 
113.txt	and you will have to go too wo n't you ?
113.txt	my dinner 's easy to carry about with me
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	mother always lets me put a bit o
113.txt	somethin
113.txt	in my pocket 
113.txt	it held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them
113.txt	it 's oftenest naught but bread
113.txt	he said
113.txt	but i 've got a fine slice o
113.txt	fat bacon with it today
113.txt	run on an
113.txt	get thy victuals
113.txt	he said
113.txt	i 'll get some more work done before i start back home
113.txt	i 'll call th
113.txt	robin up
113.txt	he said
113.txt	and give him th
113.txt	rind o
113.txt	th
113.txt	bacon to peck at  they likes a bit o
113.txt	fat wonderful 
113.txt	suddenly it seemed as if he might be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the garden again 
113.txt	he seemed too good to be true 
113.txt	she went slowly half way to the door in the wall and then she stopped and went back
113.txt	whatever happens you you never would tell ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	his poppy colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of bread and bacon but he managed to smile encouragingly
113.txt	if tha
113.txt	was a missel thrush an
113.txt	showed me where thy nest was does tha
113.txt	think i 'd tell anyone ? not me
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	art as safe as a missel thrush
113.txt	chapter xii
113.txt	might i have a bit of earth ?
113.txt	her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright pink 
113.txt	her dinner was waiting on the table and martha was waiting near it
113.txt	tha 's a bit late
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	where has tha
113.txt	been ?
113.txt	i 've seen dickon !
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i 've seen dickon !
113.txt	i knew he 'd come
113.txt	said martha exultantly 
113.txt	how does tha
113.txt	like him ?
113.txt	i think i think he 's beautiful !
113.txt	said mary in a determined voice
113.txt	martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased too
113.txt	well
113.txt	she said
113.txt	he 's th
113.txt	his nose turns up too much 
113.txt	best lad as ever was born but us never thought he was handsome 
113.txt	i like it to turn up
113.txt	an
113.txt	his eyes is so round
113.txt	said martha a trifle doubtful 
113.txt	though they 're a nice color 
113.txt	i like them round
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	and they are exactly the color of the sky over the moor
113.txt	mother says he made em that color with always lookin
113.txt	up at th
113.txt	birds an
113.txt	th
113.txt	but he has got a big mouth has n't he now ?
113.txt	clouds 
113.txt	i love his big mouth
113.txt	said mary obstinately 
113.txt	i wish mine were just like it
113.txt	it 'd look rare an
113.txt	funny in thy bit of a face
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	but i knowed it would be that way when tha
113.txt	saw him  how did tha
113.txt	like th
113.txt	seeds an
113.txt	th
113.txt	garden tools ?
113.txt	how did you know he brought them ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	eh ! i never thought of him not bringin
113.txt	he 'd be sure to bring em if they was in yorkshire 
113.txt	he 's such a trusty lad 
113.txt	em 
113.txt	she was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools and there was only one moment when mary was frightened 
113.txt	this was when she began to ask where the flowers were to be planted
113.txt	who did tha
113.txt	ask about it ?
113.txt	she inquired
113.txt	i have n't asked anybody yet
113.txt	well i would n't ask th
113.txt	he 's too grand mr roach is 
113.txt	head gardener 
113.txt	i 've never seen him
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i 've only seen undergardeners and ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	if i was you i 'd ask ben weatherstaff
113.txt	advised martha 
113.txt	he 's not half as bad as he looks for all he 's so crabbed  mr craven lets him do what he likes because he was here when mrs craven was alive an
113.txt	she liked him 
113.txt	he used to make her laugh  perhaps he 'd find you a corner somewhere out o
113.txt	the way 
113.txt	if it was out of the way and no one wanted it no one could mind my having it could they ?
113.txt	mary said anxiously
113.txt	there would n't be no reason
113.txt	answered martha 
113.txt	you would n't do no harm
113.txt	i 've got somethin
113.txt	to tell you
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i thought i 'd let you eat your dinner first  mr craven came back this mornin
113.txt	and i think he wants to see you
113.txt	oh !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	why !
113.txt	he did n't want to see me when i came 
113.txt	i heard pitcher say he did n't 
113.txt	why !
113.txt	well
113.txt	explained martha
113.txt	mrs medlock says it 's because o
113.txt	she was walkin
113.txt	to thwaite village an
113.txt	she 'd never spoke to him before but mrs craven had been to our cottage two or three times 
113.txt	she met him  he 'd forgot but mother had n't an
113.txt	she made bold to stop him  i do n't know what she said to him about you but she said somethin
113.txt	as put him in th
113.txt	mind to see you before he goes away again tomorrow
113.txt	oh !
113.txt	cried mary
113.txt	i am so glad !
113.txt	is he going away tomorrow ?
113.txt	he 's goin
113.txt	he may n't come back till autumn or winter
113.txt	he 's goin
113.txt	to travel in foreign places  he 's always doin
113.txt	it
113.txt	oh ! i 'm so glad so glad !
113.txt	said mary thankfully
113.txt	if he did not come back until winter or even autumn there would be time to watch the secret garden come alive 
113.txt	even if he found out then and took it away from her she would have had that much at least
113.txt	when do you think he will want to see
113.txt	medlock walked in 
113.txt	she had on her best black dress and cap and her collar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man 's face on it 
113.txt	it was a colored photograph of mr medlock who had died years ago and she always wore it when she was dressed up 
113.txt	she looked nervous and excited
113.txt	your hair 's rough
113.txt	she said quickly 
113.txt	martha help her to slip on her best dress 
113.txt	mr craven sent me to bring her to him in his study 
113.txt	go and brush it 
113.txt	her heart began to thump and she felt herself changing into a stiff plain silent child again 
113.txt	she did not even answer mrs medlock but turned and walked into her bedroom followed by martha 
113.txt	she said nothing while her dress was changed and her hair brushed and after she was quite tidy she followed mrs
113.txt	medlock down the corridors in silence 
113.txt	what was there for her to say ?
113.txt	she was obliged to go and see mr craven and he would not like her and she would not like him 
113.txt	she knew what he would think of her
113.txt	she was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before 
113.txt	at last mrs medlock knocked at a door and when someone said
113.txt	come in
113.txt	a man was sitting in an armchair before the fire and mrs medlock spoke to him
113.txt	this is miss mary sir
113.txt	you can go and leave her here  i will ring for you when i want you to take her away
113.txt	when she went out and closed the door mary could only stand waiting a plain little thing twisting her thin hands together 
113.txt	she could see that the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high rather crooked shoulders and he had black hair streaked with white 
113.txt	he turned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her
113.txt	come here !
113.txt	he said
113.txt	mary went to him
113.txt	he was not ugly 
113.txt	his face would have been handsome if it had not been so miserable 
113.txt	he looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him and as if he did not know what in the world to do with her
113.txt	are you well ?
113.txt	he asked
113.txt	yes
113.txt	do they take good care of you ?
113.txt	yes
113.txt	you are very thin
113.txt	i am getting fatter
113.txt	what an unhappy face he had !
113.txt	his black eyes seemed as if they scarcely saw her as if they were seeing something else and he could hardly keep his thoughts upon her
113.txt	i forgot you
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i intended to send you a governess or a nurse or someone of that sort but i forgot 
113.txt	how could i remember you ?
113.txt	please
113.txt	began mary 
113.txt	please
113.txt	what do you want to say ?
113.txt	he inquired
113.txt	i am i am too big for a nurse
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	and please please do n't make me have a governess yet
113.txt	that was what the sowerby woman said
113.txt	then mary gathered a scrap of courage
113.txt	is she is she martha 's mother ?
113.txt	she stammered
113.txt	yes i think so
113.txt	she knows about children
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	she knows 
113.txt	she has twelve
113.txt	what do you want to do ?
113.txt	i want to play out of doors
113.txt	mary answered hoping that her voice did not tremble 
113.txt	it makes me hungry here and i am getting fatter 
113.txt	i never liked it in india
113.txt	mrs sowerby said it would do you good  perhaps it will
113.txt	she thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess 
113.txt	it makes me feel strong when i play and the wind comes over the moor
113.txt	where do you play ?
113.txt	he asked next
113.txt	everywhere
113.txt	gasped mary 
113.txt	i skip and run and i look about to see if things are beginning to stick up out of the earth 
113.txt	i do n't do any harm 
113.txt	martha 's mother sent me a skipping rope 
113.txt	do n't look so frightened
113.txt	he said in a worried voice 
113.txt	you may do what you like 
113.txt	you could not do any harm a child like you !
113.txt	she came a step nearer to him
113.txt	may i ?
113.txt	she said tremulously
113.txt	her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever
113.txt	do n't look so frightened
113.txt	he exclaimed 
113.txt	i am your guardian though i am a poor one for any child 
113.txt	i can not give you time or attention 
113.txt	i am too ill and wretched and distracted
113.txt	but i wish you to be happy and comfortable 
113.txt	i do n't know anything about children but mrs 
113.txt	medlock is to see that you have all you need 
113.txt	i sent for you today because mrs sowerby said i ought to see you 
113.txt	her daughter had talked about you 
113.txt	she thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running about 
113.txt	of course you may 
113.txt	she knows all about children
113.txt	she ought to
113.txt	said mr craven 
113.txt	i thought her rather bold to stop me on the moor but she said mrs craven had been kind to her
113.txt	it seemed hard for him to speak his dead wife 's name 
113.txt	now i have seen you i think she said sensible things 
113.txt	play out of doors as much as you like 
113.txt	it 's a big place and you may go where you like and amuse yourself as you like 
113.txt	she is a respectable woman  is there anything you want ?
113.txt	as if a sudden thought had struck him 
113.txt	do you want toys books dolls ?
113.txt	might i
113.txt	quavered mary
113.txt	might i have a bit of earth ?
113.txt	mr craven looked quite startled
113.txt	earth !
113.txt	he repeated 
113.txt	what do you mean ?
113.txt	to plant seeds in to make things grow to see them come alive
113.txt	he gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over his eyes
113.txt	do you care about gardens so much
113.txt	i did n't know about them in india
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck flowers in them 
113.txt	i was always ill and tired and it was too hot  but here it is different
113.txt	craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room
113.txt	a bit of earth
113.txt	when he stopped and spoke to her his dark eyes looked almost soft and kind
113.txt	you can have as much earth as you want
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	you remind me of someone else who loved the earth and things that grow  when you see a bit of earth you want
113.txt	with something like a smile
113.txt	take it child and make it come alive 
113.txt	may i take it from anywhere if it 's not wanted ?
113.txt	anywhere
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	there ! you must go now i am tired
113.txt	he touched the bell to call mrs medlock 
113.txt	good by  i shall be away all summer
113.txt	medlock came so quickly that mary thought she must have been waiting in the corridor
113.txt	mrs medlock
113.txt	mr craven said to her
113.txt	she must be less delicate before she begins lessons 
113.txt	give her simple healthy food 
113.txt	let her run wild in the garden 
113.txt	do n't look after her too much 
113.txt	she needs liberty and fresh air and romping about 
113.txt	now i have seen the child i understand what mrs sowerby meant  mrs sowerby is to come and see her now and then and she may sometimes go to the cottage
113.txt	medlock looked pleased 
113.txt	mrs  she was relieved to hear that she need not
113.txt	look after
113.txt	she had felt her a tiresome charge and had indeed seen as little of her as she dared 
113.txt	in addition to this she was fond of martha 's mother
113.txt	thank you sir
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i never had any children myself and she 's had twelve and there never was healthier or better ones 
113.txt	miss mary can get no harm from them 
113.txt	i 'd always take susan sowerby 's advice about children myself 
113.txt	she 's what you might call healthy minded if you understand me 
113.txt	susan sowerby and me went to school together and she 's as sensible and good hearted a woman as you 'd find in a day 's walk 
113.txt	i understand
113.txt	mr craven answered 
113.txt	take miss mary away now and send pitcher to me 
113.txt	she found martha waiting there 
113.txt	martha had in fact hurried back after she had removed the dinner service
113.txt	i can have my garden !
113.txt	cried mary 
113.txt	i am not going to have a governess for a long time !
113.txt	your mother is coming to see me and i may go to your cottage !
113.txt	i may have it where i like ! he says a little girl like me could not do any harm and i may do what i like anywhere !
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	said martha delightedly
113.txt	that was nice of him was n't it ?
113.txt	martha
113.txt	said mary solemnly
113.txt	he is really a nice man only his face is so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together 
113.txt	she had been away so much longer than she had thought she should and she knew dickon would have to set out early on his five mile walk 
113.txt	when she slipped through the door under the ivy she saw he was not working where she had left him 
113.txt	the gardening tools were laid together under a tree 
113.txt	she ran to them looking all round the place but there was no dickon to be seen
113.txt	he had gone away and the secret garden was empty except for the robin who had just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose bush watching her
113.txt	he 's gone
113.txt	she said woefully 
113.txt	was he was he was he only a wood fairy ?
113.txt	oh !
113.txt	it was a piece of paper in fact it was a piece of the letter she had printed for martha to send to dickon 
113.txt	it was fastened on the bush with a long thorn and in a minute she knew dickon had left it there 
113.txt	there were some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture 
113.txt	at first she could not tell what it was 
113.txt	then she saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on it 
113.txt	something white fastened to the standard rose bush caught her eye  underneath were the printed letters and they said
113.txt	i will cum bak 
113.txt	chapter xiii
113.txt	i am colin
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	said martha with great pride 
113.txt	i never knew our dickon was as clever as that  that there 's a picture of a missel thrush on her nest as large as life an
113.txt	twice as natural 
113.txt	he had meant that she might be sure he would keep her secret 
113.txt	her garden was her nest and she was like a missel thrush 
113.txt	oh how she did like that queer common boy !
113.txt	she hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep looking forward to the morning
113.txt	but you never know what the weather will do in yorkshire particularly in the springtime 
113.txt	she was awakened in the night by the sound of rain beating with heavy drops against her window 
113.txt	it was pouring down in torrents and the wind was
113.txt	wuthering
113.txt	mary sat up in bed and felt miserable and angry
113.txt	the rain is as contrary as i ever was
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	it came because it knew i did not want it 
113.txt	she threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face  she did not cry but she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain she hated the wind and its
113.txt	wuthering
113.txt	she could not go to sleep again
113.txt	the mournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself 
113.txt	if she had felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep 
113.txt	how it
113.txt	wuthered
113.txt	it sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on crying
113.txt	she had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour when suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward the door listening 
113.txt	she listened and she listened
113.txt	it is n't the wind now
113.txt	she said in a loud whisper 
113.txt	it is different 
113.txt	it is that crying i heard before 
113.txt	that is n't the wind 
113.txt	she listened for a few minutes and each minute she became more and more sure 
113.txt	she felt as if she must find out what it was 
113.txt	it seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key 
113.txt	perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood made her bold 
113.txt	she put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor
113.txt	i am going to find out what it is
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	everybody is in bed and i do n't care about mrs medlock i do n't care !
113.txt	the corridor looked very long and dark but she was too excited to mind that 
113.txt	she thought she remembered the corners she must turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry the one mrs medlock had come through the day she lost herself 
113.txt	the sound had come up that passage 
113.txt	so she went on with her dim light almost feeling her way her heart beating so loud that she fancied she could hear it 
113.txt	the far off faint crying went on and led her 
113.txt	sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again 
113.txt	was this the right corner to turn ?
113.txt	she stopped and thought 
113.txt	yes it was
113.txt	down this passage and then to the left and then up two broad steps and then to the right again 
113.txt	yes there was the tapestry door
113.txt	she pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her and she stood in the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly though it was not loud 
113.txt	it was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few yards farther on there was a door 
113.txt	she could see a glimmer of light coming from beneath it 
113.txt	the someone was crying in that room and it was quite a young someone
113.txt	so she walked to the door and pushed it open and there she was standing in the room !
113.txt	it was a big room with ancient handsome furniture in it 
113.txt	there was a low fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the side of a carved four posted bed hung with brocade and on the bed was lying a boy crying fretfully
113.txt	mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep again and was dreaming without knowing it
113.txt	the boy had a sharp delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to have eyes too big for it 
113.txt	he had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller 
113.txt	he looked like a boy who had been ill but he was crying more as if he were tired and cross than as if he were in pain
113.txt	mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand holding her breath 
113.txt	then she crept across the room and as she drew nearer the light attracted the boy 's attention and he turned his head on his pillow and stared at her his gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed immense
113.txt	who are you ?
113.txt	he said at last in a half frightened whisper 
113.txt	are you a ghost ?
113.txt	no i am not
113.txt	mary answered her own whisper sounding half frightened 
113.txt	are you one ?
113.txt	mary could not help noticing what strange eyes he had 
113.txt	they were agate gray and they looked too big for his face because they had black lashes all round them
113.txt	no
113.txt	he replied after waiting a moment or so 
113.txt	i am colin 
113.txt	who is colin ?
113.txt	she faltered
113.txt	who are you ?
113.txt	i am colin craven 
113.txt	mr craven is my uncle 
113.txt	i am mary lennox 
113.txt	he is my father
113.txt	your father !
113.txt	gasped mary 
113.txt	why did n't they ?
113.txt	no one ever told me he had a boy !
113.txt	come here
113.txt	she came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her
113.txt	you are real are n't you ?
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	you might be one of them 
113.txt	i have such real dreams very often
113.txt	rub that and see how thick and warm it is
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	for a minute i thought you might be a dream too 
113.txt	i will pinch you a little if you like to show you how real i am 
113.txt	where did you come from ?
113.txt	he asked
113.txt	the wind wuthered so i could n't go to sleep and i heard someone crying and wanted to find out who it was 
113.txt	what were you crying for ?
113.txt	from my own room 
113.txt	tell me your name again 
113.txt	because i could n't go to sleep either and my head ached 
113.txt	did no one ever tell you i had come to live here ?
113.txt	mary lennox
113.txt	no
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	they dare n't
113.txt	why ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	because i should have been afraid you would see me  i wo n't let people see me and talk me over
113.txt	why ?
113.txt	mary asked again feeling more mystified every moment
113.txt	my father wo n't let people talk me over either 
113.txt	the servants are not allowed to speak about me 
113.txt	if i live i may be a hunchback but i sha n't live 
113.txt	my father hates to think i may be like him 
113.txt	because i am like this always ill and having to lie down 
113.txt	oh what a queer house this is !
113.txt	mary said
113.txt	everything is a kind of secret 
113.txt	rooms are locked up and gardens are locked up and you !
113.txt	have you been locked up ?
113.txt	i stay in this room because i do n't want to be moved out of it 
113.txt	it tires me too much 
113.txt	no 
113.txt	does your father come and see you ?
113.txt	mary ventured
113.txt	generally when i am asleep 
113.txt	sometimes  he does n't want to see me
113.txt	why ?
113.txt	mary could not help asking again
113.txt	a sort of angry shadow passed over the boy 's face
113.txt	he thinks i do n't know but i 've heard people talking 
113.txt	he almost hates me 
113.txt	my mother died when i was born and it makes him wretched to look at me 
113.txt	he hates the garden because she died
113.txt	what garden ?
113.txt	the boy asked
113.txt	oh ! just just a garden she used to like
113.txt	mary stammered 
113.txt	have you been here always ?
113.txt	sometimes i have been taken to places at the seaside but i wo n't stay because people stare at me 
113.txt	i used to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight but a grand doctor came from london to see me and said it was stupid 
113.txt	he told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air 
113.txt	i hate fresh air and i do n't want to go out 
113.txt	nearly always 
113.txt	i did n't when first i came here
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	why do you keep looking at me like that ?
113.txt	because of the dreams that are so real
113.txt	sometimes when i open my eyes i do n't believe i 'm awake 
113.txt	we 're both awake
113.txt	she glanced round the room with its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire light 
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	we are wide awake 
113.txt	it looks quite like a dream and it 's the middle of the night and everybody in the house is asleep everybody but us 
113.txt	i do n't want it to be a dream
113.txt	mary thought of something all at once
113.txt	if you do n't like people to see you
113.txt	she began
113.txt	do you want me to go away ?
113.txt	no
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	if you are real sit down on that big footstool and talk 
113.txt	i want to hear about you 
113.txt	i should be sure you were a dream if you went 
113.txt	she did not want to go away at all 
113.txt	she wanted to stay in the mysterious hidden away room and talk to the mysterious boy
113.txt	what do you want me to tell you ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	he wanted to know how long she had been at misselthwaite
113.txt	he wanted to know which corridor her room was on
113.txt	he wanted to know what she had been doing
113.txt	if she disliked the moor as he disliked it
113.txt	where she had lived before she came to yorkshire 
113.txt	she answered all these questions and many more and he lay back on his pillow and listened 
113.txt	he made her tell him a great deal about india and about her voyage across the ocean 
113.txt	she found out that because he had been an invalid he had not learned things as other children had 
113.txt	one of his nurses had taught him to read when he was quite little and he was always reading and looking at pictures in splendid books
113.txt	though his father rarely saw him when he was awake he was given all sorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with 
113.txt	he never seemed to have been amused however 
113.txt	he could have anything he asked for and was never made to do anything he did not like to do
113.txt	everyone is obliged to do what pleases me
113.txt	he said indifferently 
113.txt	no one believes i shall live to grow up 
113.txt	it makes me ill to be angry 
113.txt	he seemed to like the sound of mary 's voice 
113.txt	as she went on talking he listened in a drowsy interested way 
113.txt	once or twice she wondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze 
113.txt	but at last he asked a question which opened up a new subject
113.txt	how old are you ?
113.txt	he asked
113.txt	i am ten
113.txt	answered mary forgetting herself for the moment
113.txt	and so are you 
113.txt	how do you know that ?
113.txt	he demanded in a surprised voice
113.txt	and it has been locked for ten years 
113.txt	because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was buried
113.txt	who did it ?
113.txt	what garden door was locked ? where was the key buried ?
113.txt	he exclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested
113.txt	it it was the garden mr craven hates
113.txt	said mary nervously 
113.txt	no one no one knew where he buried the key 
113.txt	he locked the door 
113.txt	what sort of a garden is it ?
113.txt	colin persisted eagerly
113.txt	no one has been allowed to go into it for ten years
113.txt	but it was too late to be careful 
113.txt	he was too much like herself 
113.txt	he too had had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted him as it had attracted her 
113.txt	he asked question after question 
113.txt	where was it ?
113.txt	had she never looked for the door ?
113.txt	had she never asked the gardeners ?
113.txt	they wo n't talk about it
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i think they have been told not to answer questions 
113.txt	i would make them
113.txt	could you ?
113.txt	mary faltered beginning to feel frightened 
113.txt	if he could make people answer questions who knew what might happen !
113.txt	everyone is obliged to please me  i told you that
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	they all know that 
113.txt	i would make them tell me 
113.txt	if i were to live this place would sometime belong to me 
113.txt	he thought that the whole world belonged to him 
113.txt	how peculiar he was and how coolly he spoke of not living
113.txt	do you think you wo n't live ?
113.txt	she asked partly because she was curious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden
113.txt	i do n't suppose i shall
113.txt	he answered as indifferently as he had spoken before 
113.txt	at first they thought i was too little to understand and now they think i do n't hear 
113.txt	but i do 
113.txt	my doctor is my father 's cousin 
113.txt	he is quite poor and if i die he will have all misselthwaite when my father is dead 
113.txt	i should think he would n't want me to live 
113.txt	ever since i remember anything i have heard people say i sha n't 
113.txt	do you want to live ?
113.txt	inquired mary
113.txt	no
113.txt	he answered in a cross tired fashion
113.txt	when i feel ill i lie here and think about it until i cry and cry 
113.txt	i have heard you crying three times
113.txt	mary said
113.txt	but i did not know who it was  were you crying about that ?
113.txt	she did so want him to forget the garden
113.txt	i dare say
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	talk about that garden 
113.txt	do n't you want to see it ?
113.txt	let us talk about something else 
113.txt	yes
113.txt	i do
113.txt	he went on persistently 
113.txt	i want the key dug up 
113.txt	i want the door unlocked 
113.txt	i would let them take me there in my chair 
113.txt	that would be getting fresh air 
113.txt	i am going to make them open the door 
113.txt	i do n't think i ever really wanted to see anything before but i want to see that garden
113.txt	they have to please me
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i will make them take me there and i will let you go too 
113.txt	everything would be spoiled everything !
113.txt	dickon would never come back 
113.txt	she would never again feel like a missel thrush with a safe hidden nest
113.txt	oh do n't do n't do n't do n't do that !
113.txt	she cried out
113.txt	he stared as if he thought she had gone crazy !
113.txt	why ?
113.txt	he exclaimed 
113.txt	you said you wanted to see it 
113.txt	i do
113.txt	she answered almost with a sob in her throat
113.txt	but if you make them open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret again
113.txt	a secret
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	tell me 
113.txt	what do you mean ?
113.txt	you see you see
113.txt	she panted
113.txt	if no one knows but ourselves if there was a door hidden somewhere under the ivy if there was and we could find it
113.txt	and if we could slip through it together and shut it behind us and no one knew anyone was inside and we called it our garden and pretended that that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest and if we played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made it all come alive
113.txt	is it dead ?
113.txt	he interrupted her
113.txt	it soon will be if no one cares for it
113.txt	she went on 
113.txt	the bulbs will live but the roses
113.txt	what are bulbs ?
113.txt	he put in quickly
113.txt	they are working in the earth now pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming 
113.txt	they are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops 
113.txt	is the spring coming ?
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	what is it like ? you do n't see it in rooms if you are ill
113.txt	it is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine and things pushing up and working under the earth
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	do n't you see ?
113.txt	oh do n't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret ?
113.txt	if the garden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the things grow bigger every day and see how many roses are alive
113.txt	i never had a secret
113.txt	he said
113.txt	they do n't know i know that so it is a sort of secret 
113.txt	but i like this kind better 
113.txt	except that one about not living to grow up 
113.txt	if you wo n't make them take you to the garden
113.txt	pleaded mary
113.txt	and then if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair and if you can always do what you want to do perhaps perhaps we might find some boy who would push you and we could go alone and it would always be a secret garden 
113.txt	perhaps i feel almost sure i can find out how to get in sometime 
113.txt	i should like that
113.txt	he said very slowly his eyes looking dreamy 
113.txt	i should not mind fresh air in a secret garden 
113.txt	i should like that 
113.txt	she felt almost sure that if she kept on talking and could make him see the garden in his mind as she had seen it he would like it so much that he could not bear to think that everybody might tramp in to it when they chose
113.txt	i 'll tell you what i think it would be like if we could go into it
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	it has been shut up so long things have grown into a tangle perhaps 
113.txt	and then she told him about the robin and ben weatherstaff and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid 
113.txt	the robin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almost beautiful and at first mary had thought that he was even plainer than herself with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair
113.txt	i did not know birds could be like that
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	what a lot of things you know 
113.txt	i feel as if you had been inside that garden 
113.txt	but if you stay in a room you never see things 
113.txt	he evidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise
113.txt	i am going to let you look at something
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	do you see that rose colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel piece ?
113.txt	it was a curtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture
113.txt	yes
113.txt	there is a cord hanging from it
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	go and pull it 
113.txt	when she pulled it the silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a picture 
113.txt	it was the picture of a girl with a laughing face 
113.txt	she had bright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay lovely eyes were exactly like colin 's unhappy ones agate gray and looking twice as big as they really were because of the black lashes all round them
113.txt	she is my mother
113.txt	said colin complainingly 
113.txt	sometimes i hate her for doing it 
113.txt	i do n't see why she died 
113.txt	how queer !
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	if she had lived i believe i should not have been ill always
113.txt	he grumbled 
113.txt	and my father would not have hated to look at me 
113.txt	i dare say i should have had a strong back
113.txt	draw the curtain again
113.txt	she is much prettier than you
113.txt	she said
113.txt	why is the curtain drawn over her ?
113.txt	but her eyes are just like yours at least they are the same shape and color
113.txt	i made them do it
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	she smiles too much when i am ill and miserable
113.txt	besides she is mine and i do n't want everyone to see her
113.txt	what would mrs medlock do if she found out that i had been here ?
113.txt	she inquired
113.txt	she would do as i told her to do
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	i am glad you came 
113.txt	and i should tell her that i wanted you to come here and talk to me every day 
113.txt	so am i
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i will come as often as i can but
113.txt	she hesitated
113.txt	i shall have to look every day for the garden door 
113.txt	yes you must
113.txt	said colin
113.txt	and you can tell me about it afterward
113.txt	i think you shall be a secret too
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i can always send the nurse out of the room and say that i want to be by myself 
113.txt	do you know martha ?
113.txt	i will not tell them until they find out 
113.txt	yes i know her very well
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	she waits on me
113.txt	the nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes martha attend to me when she wants to go out 
113.txt	martha shall tell you when to come here 
113.txt	she is the one who is asleep in the other room
113.txt	martha knew about you all the time ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	the nurse likes to get away from me and then martha comes 
113.txt	yes
113.txt	she often attends to me 
113.txt	i have been here a long time
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	your eyes look sleepy 
113.txt	shall i go away now ?
113.txt	i wish i could go to sleep before you leave me
113.txt	shut your eyes
113.txt	said mary drawing her footstool closer
113.txt	i will pat your hand and stroke it and sing something quite low 
113.txt	and i will do what my ayah used to do in india 
113.txt	i should like that perhaps
113.txt	somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake so she leaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing a very low little chanting song in hindustani
113.txt	that is nice
113.txt	so she got up softly took her candle and crept away without making a sound
113.txt	chapter xiv a young rajah the moor was hidden in mist when the morning came and the rain had not stopped pouring down 
113.txt	there could be no going out of doors 
113.txt	martha was so busy that mary had no opportunity of talking to her but in the afternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery 
113.txt	she came bringing the stocking she was always knitting when she was doing nothing else
113.txt	what 's the matter with thee ?
113.txt	she asked as soon as they sat down
113.txt	tha
113.txt	looks as if tha 'd somethin
113.txt	to say 
113.txt	i have  i have found out what the crying was
113.txt	martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startled eyes
113.txt	tha
113.txt	has n't !
113.txt	she exclaimed 
113.txt	never !
113.txt	i heard it in the night
113.txt	mary went on 
113.txt	it was colin 
113.txt	i found him 
113.txt	and i got up and went to see where it came from
113.txt	eh ! miss mary !
113.txt	she said half crying 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	should n't have done it tha
113.txt	tha 'll get me in trouble 
113.txt	should n't ! i never told thee nothin
113.txt	i shall lose my place and what 'll mother do !
113.txt	about him but tha 'll get me in trouble 
113.txt	you wo n't lose your place
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	we talked and talked and he said he was glad i came 
113.txt	he was glad i came 
113.txt	was he ?
113.txt	cried martha 
113.txt	art tha
113.txt	sure ? tha
113.txt	he 's a big lad to cry like a baby but when he 's in a passion he 'll fair scream just to frighten us 
113.txt	he knows us dare n't call our souls our own 
113.txt	does n't know what he 's like when anything vexes him 
113.txt	he was n't vexed
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	he asked me questions and i sat on a big footstool and talked to him about india and about the robin and gardens 
113.txt	he would n't let me go 
113.txt	he let me see his mother 's picture 
113.txt	before i left him i sang him to sleep 
113.txt	i asked him if i should go away and he made me stay
113.txt	i can scarcely believe thee !
113.txt	she protested 
113.txt	it 's as if tha 'd walked straight into a lion 's den  if he 'd been like he is most times he 'd have throwed himself into one of his tantrums and roused th
113.txt	he wo n't let strangers look at him 
113.txt	house 
113.txt	i looked at him all the time and he looked at me 
113.txt	he let me look at him  we stared !
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	i do n't know what to do !
113.txt	cried agitated martha 
113.txt	if mrs medlock finds out she 'll think i broke orders and told thee and i shall be packed back to mother 
113.txt	he is not going to tell mrs medlock anything about it yet  it 's to be a sort of secret just at first
113.txt	said mary firmly 
113.txt	and he says everybody is obliged to do as he pleases 
113.txt	aye that 's true enough th
113.txt	bad lad !
113.txt	sighed martha wiping her forehead with her apron
113.txt	and he wants me to come and talk to him every day 
113.txt	he says mrs medlock must  and you are to tell me when he wants me
113.txt	me !
113.txt	said martha
113.txt	i shall lose my place i shall for sure !
113.txt	you ca n't if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody is ordered to obey him
113.txt	does tha
113.txt	mean to say
113.txt	cried martha with wide open eyes
113.txt	that he was nice to thee !
113.txt	i think he almost liked me
113.txt	then tha
113.txt	must have bewitched him !
113.txt	decided martha drawing a long breath
113.txt	do you mean magic ?
113.txt	inquired mary 
113.txt	i just went into his room and i was so surprised to see him i stood and stared 
113.txt	and then he turned round and stared at me 
113.txt	and he thought i was a ghost or a dream and i thought perhaps he was 
113.txt	and it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of the night and not knowing about each other 
113.txt	and we began to ask each other questions 
113.txt	and when i asked him if i must go away he said i must not 
113.txt	i 've heard about magic in india but i ca n't make it 
113.txt	th
113.txt	world 's comin
113.txt	to a end !
113.txt	gasped martha
113.txt	what is the matter with him ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	nobody knows for sure and certain
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	mr craven went off his head like when he was born  th
113.txt	it was because mrs craven died like i told you 
113.txt	doctors thought he 'd have to be put in a sylum  he would n't set eyes on th
113.txt	he just raved and said it 'd be another hunchback like him and it 'd better die 
113.txt	baby 
113.txt	is colin a hunchback ?
113.txt	mary asked 
113.txt	he did n't look like one 
113.txt	he is n't yet
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	but he began all wrong  mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th
113.txt	house to set any child wrong  they was afraid his back was weak an
113.txt	they 've always been takin
113.txt	care of it keepin
113.txt	him lyin
113.txt	down and not lettin
113.txt	him walk  once they made him wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill then a big doctor came to see him an
113.txt	made them take it off  he talked to th
113.txt	other doctor quite rough in a polite way  he said there 'd been too much medicine and too much lettin
113.txt	him have his own way 
113.txt	i think he 's a very spoiled boy
113.txt	he 's th
113.txt	worst young nowt as ever was !
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	i wo n't say as he has n't been ill a good bit  he 's had coughs an
113.txt	colds that 's nearly killed him two or three times  once he had rheumatic fever an
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	mrs medlock did get a fright then 
113.txt	once he had typhoid  he 'd been out of his head an
113.txt	she was talkin
113.txt	to th
113.txt	nurse thinkin
113.txt	he did n't know nothin
113.txt	an
113.txt	she said he 'll die this time sure enough an
113.txt	best thing for him an
113.txt	for everybody
113.txt	an
113.txt	she looked at him an
113.txt	there he was with his big eyes open starin
113.txt	at her as sensible as she was herself  she did n't know wha 'd happen but he just stared at her an
113.txt	says you give me some water an
113.txt	stop talkin
113.txt	
113.txt	do you think he will die ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	mother says there 's no reason why any child should live that gets no fresh air an
113.txt	does n't do nothin
113.txt	but lie on his back an
113.txt	read picture books an
113.txt	take medicine  he 's weak and hates th
113.txt	trouble o
113.txt	bein
113.txt	taken out o
113.txt	doors an
113.txt	he gets cold so easy he says it makes him ill
113.txt	i wonder
113.txt	she said slowly
113.txt	it did me good 
113.txt	if it would not do him good to go out into a garden and watch things growing 
113.txt	one of th
113.txt	worst fits he ever had
113.txt	said martha
113.txt	was one time they took him out where the roses is by the fountain  he 'd been readin
113.txt	in a paper about people gettin
113.txt	somethin
113.txt	he called rose cold
113.txt	an
113.txt	he began to sneeze an
113.txt	said he 'd got it an
113.txt	then a new gardener as did n't know th
113.txt	rules passed by an
113.txt	looked at him curious  he threw himself into a passion an
113.txt	he said he 'd looked at him because he was going to be a hunchback  he cried himself into a fever an
113.txt	was ill all night 
113.txt	if he ever gets angry at me i 'll never go and see him again
113.txt	he 'll have thee if he wants thee
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	tha
113.txt	may as well know that at th
113.txt	start
113.txt	i dare say th
113.txt	nurse wants me to stay with him a bit
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i hope he 's in a good temper
113.txt	well tha
113.txt	has bewitched him
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	he 's told the nurse to stay away until six oclock 
113.txt	i 'm to wait in the next room 
113.txt	he 's up on his sofa with his picture books  th
113.txt	minute she was gone he called me to him an
113.txt	says
113.txt	you 'd better go as quick as you can 
113.txt	i want mary lennox to come and talk to me and remember you 're not to tell anyone
113.txt	she did not want to see colin as much as she wanted to see dickon
113.txt	but she wanted to see him very much
113.txt	there was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room and in the daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed 
113.txt	there were rich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls which made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray sky and falling rain 
113.txt	colin looked rather like a picture himself
113.txt	he was wrapped in a velvet dressing gown and sat against a big brocaded cushion 
113.txt	he had a red spot on each cheek
113.txt	come in
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i 've been thinking about you all morning 
113.txt	i 've been thinking about you too
113.txt	answered mary 
113.txt	she says mrs medlock will think she told me about you and then she will be sent away 
113.txt	you do n't know how frightened martha is
113.txt	go and tell her to come here
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	she is in the next room 
113.txt	poor martha was shaking in her shoes
113.txt	colin was still frowning
113.txt	have you to do what i please or have you not ?
113.txt	he demanded
113.txt	i have to do what you please sir
113.txt	has medlock to do what i please ?
113.txt	everybody has sir
113.txt	well then if i order you to bring miss mary to me how can medlock send you away if she finds it out ?
113.txt	please do n't let her sir
113.txt	i 'll send her away if she dares to say a word about such a thing
113.txt	said master craven grandly 
113.txt	she would n't like that i can tell you 
113.txt	thank you sir
113.txt	bobbing a curtsy
113.txt	i want to do my duty sir 
113.txt	what i want is your duty
113.txt	said colin more grandly still 
113.txt	now go away 
113.txt	i 'll take care of you
113.txt	why do you look at me like that ?
113.txt	he asked her 
113.txt	what are you thinking about ?
113.txt	i am thinking about two things 
113.txt	sit down and tell me 
113.txt	what are they ?
113.txt	this is the first one
113.txt	he had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him 
113.txt	he spoke to his people just as you spoke to martha 
113.txt	everybody had to do everything he told them in a minute 
113.txt	i think they would have been killed if they had n't 
113.txt	once in india i saw a boy who was a rajah 
113.txt	i shall make you tell me about rajahs presently
113.txt	he said
113.txt	but first tell me what the second thing was 
113.txt	i was thinking
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	how different you are from dickon 
113.txt	who is dickon ?
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	what a queer name !
113.txt	she had liked to hear martha talk about him 
113.txt	besides she longed to talk about him 
113.txt	it would seem to bring him nearer
113.txt	he is martha 's brother  he is twelve years old
113.txt	she explained 
113.txt	he can charm foxes and squirrels and birds just as the natives in india charm snakes 
113.txt	he plays a very soft tune on a pipe and they come and listen 
113.txt	he is not like anyone else in the world
113.txt	there is a picture of a snake charmer in this
113.txt	he exclaimed 
113.txt	come and look at it
113.txt	can he do that ?
113.txt	he asked eagerly
113.txt	he played on his pipe and they listened
113.txt	mary explained 
113.txt	he says it 's because he lives on the moor so much and he knows their ways 
113.txt	he says he feels sometimes as if he was a bird or a rabbit himself he likes them so 
113.txt	i think he asked the robin questions 
113.txt	it seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps 
113.txt	but he does n't call it magic
113.txt	tell me some more about him
113.txt	he knows all about eggs and nests
113.txt	mary went on 
113.txt	he keeps them secret so that other boys wo n't find their holes and frighten them 
113.txt	he knows about everything that grows or lives on the moor 
113.txt	and he knows where foxes and badgers and otters live 
113.txt	does he like the moor ?
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	how can he when it 's such a great bare dreary place ?
113.txt	it 's the most beautiful place
113.txt	protested mary 
113.txt	they are so busy and having such fun under the earth or in the trees or heather 
113.txt	it 's their world 
113.txt	thousands of lovely things grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busy building nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singing or squeaking to each other 
113.txt	how do you know all that ?
113.txt	said colin turning on his elbow to look at her
113.txt	i have never been there once really
113.txt	i thought it was hideous 
113.txt	martha told me about it first and then dickon 
113.txt	when dickon talks about it you feel as if you saw things and heard them and as if you were standing in the heather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey and all full of bees and butterflies 
113.txt	i only drove over it in the dark 
113.txt	you never see anything if you are ill
113.txt	he looked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance and wondering what it was
113.txt	you ca n't if you stay in a room
113.txt	i could n't go on the moor
113.txt	mary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold
113.txt	you might sometime
113.txt	how could i ?
113.txt	i am going to die 
113.txt	go on the moor !
113.txt	how do you know ?
113.txt	said mary unsympathetically 
113.txt	she did n't like the way he had of talking about dying 
113.txt	she did not feel very sympathetic 
113.txt	she felt rather as if he almost boasted about it
113.txt	oh i 've heard it ever since i remember
113.txt	he answered crossly 
113.txt	they wish i would too 
113.txt	they are always whispering about it and thinking i do n't notice 
113.txt	she pinched her lips together
113.txt	if they wished i would
113.txt	she said
113.txt	who wishes you would ?
113.txt	i would n't 
113.txt	he dare n't say so but he always looks cheerful when i am worse 
113.txt	when i had typhoid fever his face got quite fat 
113.txt	i think my father wishes it too 
113.txt	the servants and of course dr craven because he would get misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor 
113.txt	i do n't believe he does
113.txt	that made colin turn and look at her again
113.txt	do n't you ?
113.txt	he said
113.txt	and then he lay back on his cushion and was still as if he were thinking 
113.txt	and there was quite a long silence 
113.txt	perhaps they were both of them thinking strange things children do not usually think of
113.txt	i like the grand doctor from london because he made them take the iron thing off
113.txt	said mary at last
113.txt	did he say you were going to die ?
113.txt	no 
113.txt	what did he say ?
113.txt	he did n't whisper
113.txt	colin answered 
113.txt	i heard him say one thing quite aloud 
113.txt	he said the lad might live if he would make up his mind to it 
113.txt	put him in the humor 
113.txt	it sounded as if he was in a temper 
113.txt	perhaps he knew i hated whispering 
113.txt	i 'll tell you who would put you in the humor perhaps
113.txt	she felt as if she would like this thing to be settled one way or the other 
113.txt	said mary reflecting 
113.txt	he 's always talking about live things 
113.txt	he never talks about dead things or things that are ill
113.txt	he 's always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying or looking down at the earth to see something growing 
113.txt	he has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with looking about 
113.txt	and he laughs such a big laugh with his wide mouth and his cheeks are as red as red as cherries
113.txt	see here
113.txt	she said
113.txt	let us talk about living 
113.txt	let us talk and talk about dickon 
113.txt	and then we will look at your pictures 
113.txt	to talk about dickon meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in it on sixteen shillings a week and the children who got fat on the moor grass like the wild ponies 
113.txt	and about dickon 's mother and the skipping rope and the moor with the sun on it and about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod 
113.txt	and it was all so alive that mary talked more than she had ever talked before and colin both talked and listened as he had never done either before 
113.txt	and they both began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together 
113.txt	and they laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten year old creatures instead of a hard little unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to die
113.txt	they enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they forgot about the time 
113.txt	they had been laughing quite loudly over ben weatherstaff and his robin and colin was actually sitting up as if he had forgotten about his weak back when he suddenly remembered something
113.txt	do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	we are cousins 
113.txt	and in the midst of the fun the door opened and in walked dr craven and mrs medlock
113.txt	dr craven started in actual alarm and mrs medlock almost fell back because he had accidentally bumped against her
113.txt	good lord !
113.txt	exclaimed poor mrs medlock with her eyes almost starting out of her head 
113.txt	good lord !
113.txt	what is this ?
113.txt	said dr craven coming forward 
113.txt	what does it mean ?
113.txt	colin answered as if neither the doctor 's alarm nor mrs medlock 's terror were of the slightest consequence 
113.txt	he was as little disturbed or frightened as if an elderly cat and dog had walked into the room
113.txt	this is my cousin mary lennox
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i like her 
113.txt	i asked her to come and talk to me  she must come and talk to me whenever i send for her
113.txt	craven turned reproachfully to mrs medlock
113.txt	oh sir
113.txt	she panted 
113.txt	there 's not a servant on the place tha 'd dare to talk they all have their orders 
113.txt	i do n't know how it 's happened 
113.txt	nobody told her anything
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	i am glad she came 
113.txt	do n't be silly medlock 
113.txt	she heard me crying and found me herself 
113.txt	he sat down by colin and felt his pulse
113.txt	i am afraid there has been too much excitement  excitement is not good for you my boy
113.txt	i should be excited if she kept away
113.txt	answered colin his eyes beginning to look dangerously sparkling 
113.txt	she makes me better 
113.txt	the nurse must bring up her tea with mine 
113.txt	i am better  we will have tea together
113.txt	medlock and dr craven looked at each other in a troubled way but there was evidently nothing to be done
113.txt	he does look rather better sir
113.txt	but
113.txt	thinking the matter over
113.txt	he looked better this morning before she came into the room 
113.txt	she stayed with me a long time 
113.txt	she came into the room last night  she sang a hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep
113.txt	i wanted my breakfast 
113.txt	i want my tea now 
113.txt	i was better when i wakened up  tell nurse medlock
113.txt	craven did not stay very long 
113.txt	he talked to the nurse for a few minutes when she came into the room and said a few words of warning to colin 
113.txt	he must not talk too much
113.txt	he must not forget that he was ill
113.txt	he must not forget that he was very easily tired 
113.txt	mary thought that there seemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not to forget
113.txt	colin looked fretful and kept his strange black lashed eyes fixed on dr 
113.txt	craven 's face
113.txt	i want to forget it
113.txt	he said at last 
113.txt	she makes me forget it  that is why i want her
113.txt	craven did not look happy when he left the room 
113.txt	he gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on the large stool 
113.txt	she had become a stiff silent child again as soon as he entered and he could not see what the attraction was 
113.txt	the boy actually did look brighter however and he sighed rather heavily as he went down the corridor
113.txt	they are always wanting me to eat things when i do n't want to
113.txt	said colin as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by the sofa 
113.txt	those muffins look so nice and hot
113.txt	tell me about rajahs 
113.txt	though there had been no chance to see either the secret garden or dickon mistress mary had enjoyed herself very much 
113.txt	the week had not seemed long 
113.txt	she had spent hours of every day with colin in his room talking about rajahs or gardens or dickon and the cottage on the moor 
113.txt	they had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes mary had read things to colin and sometimes he had read a little to her 
113.txt	when he was amused and interested she thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all except that his face was so colorless and he was always on the sofa
113.txt	you are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go following things up like you did that night
113.txt	he 's not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends 
113.txt	but there 's no saying it 's not been a sort of blessing to the lot of us  the nurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick of him but she says she does n't mind staying now you 've gone on duty with her
113.txt	in her talks with colin mary had tried to be very cautious about the secret garden 
113.txt	there were certain things she wanted to find out from him but she felt that she must find them out without asking him direct questions 
113.txt	in the first place as she began to like to be with him she wanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to 
113.txt	he was not in the least like dickon but he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she thought perhaps he could be trusted 
113.txt	but she had not known him long enough to be sure 
113.txt	the second thing she wanted to find out was this if he could be trusted if he really could would n't it be possible to take him to the garden without having anyone find it out ?
113.txt	the grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air and colin had said that he would not mind fresh air in a secret garden 
113.txt	perhaps if he had a great deal of fresh air and knew dickon and the robin and saw things growing he might not think so much about dying 
113.txt	mary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a different creature from the child she had seen when she arrived from india 
113.txt	this child looked nicer 
113.txt	even martha had seen a change in her
113.txt	th
113.txt	air from th
113.txt	moor has done thee good already
113.txt	thart not nigh so yeller and thart not nigh so scrawny  even tha
113.txt	hair does n't slamp down on tha
113.txt	it 's got some life in it so as it sticks out a bit 
113.txt	head so flat 
113.txt	it 's like me
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i 'm sure there 's more of it 
113.txt	it 's growing stronger and fatter 
113.txt	it looks it for sure
113.txt	said martha ruffling it up a little round her face 
113.txt	thart not half so ugly when it 's that way an
113.txt	there 's a bit o
113.txt	red in tha
113.txt	cheeks 
113.txt	but then if he hated people to look at him perhaps he would not like to see dickon
113.txt	why does it make you angry when you are looked at ?
113.txt	she inquired one day
113.txt	i always hated it
113.txt	he answered
113.txt	then when they took me to the seaside and i used to lie in my carriage everybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse and then they would begin to whisper and i knew then they were saying i should n't live to grow up 
113.txt	then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks and say poor child !
113.txt	
113.txt	once when a lady did that i screamed out loud and bit her hand 
113.txt	she was so frightened she ran away 
113.txt	even when i was very little 
113.txt	she thought you had gone mad like a dog
113.txt	i do n't care what she thought
113.txt	i wonder why you did n't scream and bite me when i came into your room ?
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	then she began to smile slowly
113.txt	i thought you were a ghost or a dream
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	you ca n't bite a ghost or a dream and if you scream they do n't care 
113.txt	would you hate it if if a boy looked at you ?
113.txt	mary asked uncertainly
113.txt	he lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully
113.txt	there 's one boy
113.txt	he said quite slowly as if he were thinking over every word
113.txt	it 's that boy who knows where the foxes live dickon 
113.txt	there 's one boy i believe i should n't mind 
113.txt	i 'm sure you would n't mind him
113.txt	the birds do n't and other animals
113.txt	he said still thinking it over
113.txt	he 's a sort of animal charmer and i am a boy animal 
113.txt	perhaps that 's why i should n't
113.txt	what mary felt afterward was that she need not fear about dickon
113.txt	on that first morning when the sky was blue again mary wakened very early 
113.txt	the sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and there was something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of bed and ran to the window 
113.txt	she drew up the blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft of fresh scented air blew in upon her 
113.txt	the moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something magic had happened to it 
113.txt	there were tender little fluting sounds here and there and everywhere as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a concert 
113.txt	mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun
113.txt	it 's warm warm !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	it will make the green points push up and up and up and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with all their might under the earth
113.txt	it must be very early
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	no one is up 
113.txt	i do n't even hear the stable boys 
113.txt	the little clouds are all pink and i 've never seen the sky look like this
113.txt	i am going to see the garden !
113.txt	i ca n't wait !
113.txt	she knew a small side door which she could unbolt herself and she flew downstairs in her stocking feet and put on her shoes in the hall 
113.txt	she unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when the door was open she sprang across the step with one bound and there she was standing on the grass which seemed to have turned green and with the sun pouring down on her and warm sweet wafts about her and the fluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree 
113.txt	she clasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light that she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it 
113.txt	she ran around the shrubs and paths towards the secret garden
113.txt	it is all different already
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	this afternoon i am sure dickon will come 
113.txt	the grass is greener and things are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing 
113.txt	there were things sprouting and pushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses 
113.txt	six months before mistress mary would not have seen how the world was waking up but now she missed nothing
113.txt	when she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy she was startled by a curious loud sound 
113.txt	it was the caw caw of a crow and it came from the top of the wall and when she looked up there sat a big glossy plumaged blue black bird looking down at her very wisely indeed 
113.txt	she had never seen a crow so close before and he made her a little nervous but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped away across the garden 
113.txt	she hoped he was not going to stay inside and she pushed the door open wondering if he would 
113.txt	when she got fairly into the garden she saw that he probably did intend to stay because he had alighted on a dwarf apple tree and under the apple tree was lying a little reddish animal with a bushy tail and both of them were watching the stooping body and rust red head of dickon who was kneeling on the grass working hard
113.txt	mary flew across the grass to him
113.txt	oh dickon ! dickon !
113.txt	she cried out
113.txt	how could you !
113.txt	the sun has only just got up !
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	how could i have stayed abed !

113.txt	oh dickon ! dickon !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i 'm so happy i can scarcely breathe !
113.txt	this is th
113.txt	little fox cub
113.txt	he said rubbing the little reddish animal 's head 
113.txt	it 's named captain  an
113.txt	this here 's soot  soot he flew across th
113.txt	moor with me an
113.txt	captain he run same as if th
113.txt	they both felt same as i did 
113.txt	hounds had been after him
113.txt	when dickon began to walk about soot stayed on his shoulder and captain trotted quietly close to his side
113.txt	see here !
113.txt	said dickon 
113.txt	see how these has pushed up an
113.txt	these an
113.txt	these ! an
113.txt	look at these here !
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	they had come upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold 
113.txt	mary bent her face down and kissed and kissed them
113.txt	you never kiss a person in that way
113.txt	she said when she lifted her head 
113.txt	flowers are so different
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	he said
113.txt	i 've kissed mother many a time that way when i come in from th
113.txt	moor after a day 's roamin
113.txt	an
113.txt	she stood there at th
113.txt	door in th
113.txt	sun lookin
113.txt	so glad an
113.txt	comfortable 
113.txt	he showed her swelling leafbuds on rose branches which had seemed dead 
113.txt	he showed her ten thousand new green points pushing through the mould 
113.txt	they put their eager young noses close to the earth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing
113.txt	they dug and pulled and laughed low with rapture until mistress mary 's hair was as tumbled as dickon 's and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his
113.txt	there was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning and in the midst of them came a delight more delightful than all because it was more wonderful 
113.txt	swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the trees to a close grown corner a little flare of red breasted bird with something hanging from its beak 
113.txt	dickon stood quite still and put his hand on mary almost as if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church
113.txt	we munnot stir
113.txt	he whispered in broad yorkshire 
113.txt	we munnot scarce breathe  i knowed he was mate huntin
113.txt	it 's ben weatherstaff 's robin 
113.txt	when i seed him last  he 's buildin
113.txt	he 'll stay here if us do n't flight him 
113.txt	his nest
113.txt	us must n't seem as if us was watchin
113.txt	him too close
113.txt	he 'd be out with us for good if he got th
113.txt	notion us was interferin
113.txt	he 'll be a good bit different till all this is over 
113.txt	now  he 's settin
113.txt	up housekeepin
113.txt	 he 'll be shyer an
113.txt	readier to take things ill  he 's got no time for visitin
113.txt	an
113.txt	gossipin
113.txt	 us must keep still a bit an
113.txt	try to look as if us was grass an
113.txt	trees an
113.txt	bushes  then when he 's got used to seein
113.txt	us i 'll chirp a bit an
113.txt	he 'll know us 'll not be in his way 
113.txt	but he had said the queer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in the world and she felt it must be quite easy to him and indeed she watched him for a few minutes carefully wondering if it was possible for him to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves 
113.txt	but he only sat wonderfully still and when he spoke dropped his voice to such a softness that it was curious that she could hear him but she could
113.txt	it 's part o
113.txt	th
113.txt	springtime this nest buildin
113.txt	is
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i warrant it 's been goin
113.txt	on in th
113.txt	same way every year since th
113.txt	world was begun  they 've got their way o
113.txt	thinkin
113.txt	and doin
113.txt	things an
113.txt	you can lose a friend in springtime easier than any other season if you 're too curious 
113.txt	a body had better not meddle 
113.txt	if we talk about him i ca n't help looking at him
113.txt	mary said as softly as possible 
113.txt	there is something i want to tell you 
113.txt	we must talk of something else 
113.txt	he 'll like it better if us talks o
113.txt	somethin
113.txt	else
113.txt	what is it tha 's got to tell me ?
113.txt	well do you know about colin ?
113.txt	she whispered
113.txt	he turned his head to look at her
113.txt	what does tha
113.txt	know about him ?
113.txt	he asked
113.txt	i have been to talk to him every day this week 
113.txt	he wants me to come 
113.txt	i 've seen him  he says i 'm making him forget about being ill and dying
113.txt	dickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away from his round face
113.txt	i am glad o
113.txt	that
113.txt	he exclaimed 
113.txt	it makes me easier 
113.txt	i 'm right down glad  i knowed i must say nothin
113.txt	about him an
113.txt	i do n't like havin
113.txt	to hide things 
113.txt	do n't you like hiding the garden ?
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	i 'll never tell about it
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	but i says to mother mother
113.txt	i says
113.txt	i got a secret to keep  it 's not a bad un tha
113.txt	knows that  it 's no worse than hidin
113.txt	where a bird 's nest is  tha
113.txt	does n't mind it does tha
113.txt	?
113.txt	what did she say ?
113.txt	she asked not at all afraid to hear
113.txt	dickon grinned sweet temperedly
113.txt	it was just like her what she said
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	she give my head a bit of a rub an
113.txt	laughed an
113.txt	she says eh lad tha
113.txt	can have all th
113.txt	secrets tha
113.txt	likes  i 've knowed thee twelve year
113.txt	
113.txt	how did you know about colin ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	everybody as knowed about mester craven knowed there was a little lad as was like to be a cripple an
113.txt	folks is sorry for mester craven because mrs
113.txt	craven was such a pretty young lady an
113.txt	mrs medlock stops in our cottage whenever she goes to thwaite an
113.txt	she does n't mind talkin
113.txt	to mother before us children because she knows us has been brought up to be trusty  how did tha
113.txt	martha was in fine trouble th
113.txt	last time she came home  she said tha 'd heard him frettin
113.txt	an
113.txt	tha
113.txt	was askin
113.txt	questions an
113.txt	she did n't know what to say 
113.txt	when she described the small ivory white face and the strange black rimmed eyes dickon shook his head
113.txt	them 's just like his mother 's eyes only hers was always laughin
113.txt	they say
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	they say as mr craven ca n't bear to see him when he 's awake an
113.txt	it 's because his eyes is so like his mother 's an
113.txt	yet looks so different in his miserable bit of a face 
113.txt	do you think he wants to die ?
113.txt	whispered mary
113.txt	no but he wishes he 'd never been born  mother she says that 's th
113.txt	them as is not wanted scarce ever thrives 
113.txt	worst thing on earth for a child  mester craven he 'd buy anythin
113.txt	as money could buy for th
113.txt	for one thing he 's afraid he 'll look at him some day and find he 's growed hunchback 
113.txt	poor lad but he 'd like to forget as he 's on earth 
113.txt	colin 's so afraid of it himself that he wo n't sit up
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	he says he 's always thinking that if he should feel a lump coming he should go crazy and scream himself to death
113.txt	eh ! he ought n't to lie there thinkin
113.txt	things like that
113.txt	no lad could get well as thought them sort o
113.txt	things 
113.txt	presently he lifted his head and looked round the garden
113.txt	when first we got in here
113.txt	he said
113.txt	it seemed like everything was gray  look round now and tell me if tha
113.txt	does n't see a difference
113.txt	why !
113.txt	she cried
113.txt	it is as if a green mist were creeping over it 
113.txt	it 's almost like a green gauze veil 
113.txt	the gray wall is changing 
113.txt	aye
113.txt	said dickon 
113.txt	an
113.txt	it 'll be greener and greener till th
113.txt	gray 's all gone  can tha
113.txt	guess what i was thinkin
113.txt	?
113.txt	i know it was something nice
113.txt	said mary eagerly 
113.txt	i believe it was something about colin 
113.txt	i was thinkin
113.txt	that if he was out here he would n't be watchin
113.txt	for lumps to grow on his back
113.txt	he 'd be watchin
113.txt	for buds to break on th
113.txt	rose bushes an
113.txt	he 'd likely be healthier
113.txt	explained dickon 
113.txt	i was wonderin
113.txt	if us could ever get him in th
113.txt	humor to come out here an
113.txt	lie under th
113.txt	trees in his carriage 
113.txt	i 've been wondering that myself  i 've thought of it almost every time i 've talked to him
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i thought perhaps you could push his carriage 
113.txt	the doctor said he must have fresh air and if he wants us to take him out no one dare disobey him 
113.txt	he wo n't go out for other people and perhaps they will be glad if he will go out with us 
113.txt	he could order the gardeners to keep away so they would n't find out 
113.txt	i 've wondered if he could keep a secret and i 've wondered if we could bring him here without anyone seeing us
113.txt	it 'd be good for him i 'll warrant
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	us 'd not be thinkin
113.txt	he 'd better never been born  us 'd be just two children watchin
113.txt	a garden grow an
113.txt	he 'd be another  two lads an
113.txt	a little lass just lookin
113.txt	on at th
113.txt	i warrant it 'd be better than doctor 's stuff 
113.txt	springtime 
113.txt	he 's been lying in his room so long and he 's always been so afraid of his back that it has made him queer
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	he says he has been too ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors and hates gardens and gardeners 
113.txt	but he likes to hear about this garden because it is a secret 
113.txt	i dare n't tell him much but he said he wanted to see it 
113.txt	he knows a good many things out of books but he does n't know anything else 
113.txt	us 'll have him out here sometime for sure
113.txt	said dickon 
113.txt	i could push his carriage well enough  has tha
113.txt	noticed how th
113.txt	robin an
113.txt	his mate has been workin
113.txt	while we 've been sittin
113.txt	here ? look at him perched on that branch wonderin
113.txt	where it 'd be best to put that twig he 's got in his beak 
113.txt	dickon spoke to him as ben weatherstaff did but dickon 's tone was one of friendly advice
113.txt	wheresever tha
113.txt	puts it
113.txt	he said
113.txt	it 'll be all right  tha
113.txt	knew how to build tha
113.txt	nest before tha
113.txt	came out o
113.txt	th
113.txt	get on with thee lad 
113.txt	thast got no time to lose 
113.txt	egg 
113.txt	oh i do like to hear you talk to him !
113.txt	mary said laughing delightedly 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather have stones thrown at him than not be noticed 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff scolds him and makes fun of him and he hops about and looks as if he understood every word and i know he likes it
113.txt	tha
113.txt	knows us wo n't trouble thee
113.txt	he said to the robin 
113.txt	us is near bein
113.txt	wild things ourselves  us is nest buildin
113.txt	too bless thee  look out tha
113.txt	does n't tell on us
113.txt	chapter xvi
113.txt	i wo n't !
113.txt	said mary they found a great deal to do that morning and mary was late in returning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to her work that she quite forgot colin until the last moment
113.txt	tell colin that i ca n't come and see him yet
113.txt	i 'm very busy in the garden
113.txt	eh ! miss mary
113.txt	she said
113.txt	it may put him all out of humor when i tell him that
113.txt	i ca n't stay
113.txt	she answered 
113.txt	dickon 's waiting for me
113.txt	the afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been
113.txt	already nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most of the roses and trees had been pruned or dug about 
113.txt	dickon had brought a spade of his own and he had taught mary to use all her tools so that by this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was not likely to become a
113.txt	gardener 's garden
113.txt	there 'll be apple blossoms an
113.txt	cherry blossoms overhead
113.txt	dickon said working away with all his might 
113.txt	an
113.txt	there 'll be peach an
113.txt	plum trees in bloom against th
113.txt	walls an
113.txt	th
113.txt	grass 'll be a carpet o
113.txt	flowers 
113.txt	sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away over the tree tops in the park 
113.txt	each time he came back and perched near dickon and cawed several times as if he were relating his adventures and dickon talked to him just as he had talked to the robin 
113.txt	once when dickon was so busy that he did not answer him at first soot flew on to his shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his large beak 
113.txt	when mary wanted to rest a little dickon sat down with her under a tree and once he took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange little notes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened
113.txt	tha 's a good bit stronger than tha
113.txt	was
113.txt	dickon said looking at her as she was digging 
113.txt	tha 's beginning to look different for sure
113.txt	i 'm getting fatter and fatter every day
113.txt	martha says my hair is growing thicker 
113.txt	it is n't so flat and stringy 
113.txt	mrs medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses
113.txt	it 'll be fine tomorrow
113.txt	said dickon 
113.txt	i 'll be at work by sunrise 
113.txt	so will i
113.txt	she ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her 
113.txt	she wanted to tell colin about dickon 's fox cub and the rook and about what the springtime had been doing 
113.txt	she felt sure he would like to hear 
113.txt	so it was not very pleasant when she opened the door of her room to see martha standing waiting for her with a doleful face
113.txt	what is the matter ?
113.txt	she asked 
113.txt	what did colin say when you told him i could n't come ?
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	said martha
113.txt	i wish tha 'd gone  he was nigh goin
113.txt	into one o
113.txt	there 's been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him quiet 
113.txt	his tantrums  he would watch the clock all th
113.txt	time 
113.txt	she was no more used to considering other people than colin was and she saw no reason why an ill tempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best 
113.txt	she knew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and nervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers and need not make other people ill and nervous too 
113.txt	when she had had a headache in india she had done her best to see that everybody else also had a headache or something quite as bad 
113.txt	and she felt she was quite right
113.txt	but of course now she felt that colin was quite wrong
113.txt	he was not on his sofa when she went into his room 
113.txt	he was lying flat on his back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came in 
113.txt	this was a bad beginning and mary marched up to him with her stiff manner
113.txt	why did n't you get up ?
113.txt	she said
113.txt	i did get up this morning when i thought you were coming
113.txt	he answered without looking at her 
113.txt	my back ached and my head ached and i was tired 
113.txt	why did n't you come ?
113.txt	i made them put me back in bed this afternoon 
113.txt	i was working in the garden with dickon
113.txt	colin frowned and condescended to look at her
113.txt	i wo n't let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead of coming to talk to me
113.txt	mary flew into a fine passion 
113.txt	she could fly into a passion without making a noise 
113.txt	she just grew sour and obstinate and did not care what happened
113.txt	if you send dickon away i 'll never come into this room again !
113.txt	she retorted
113.txt	you 'll have to if i want you
113.txt	i wo n't !
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	i 'll make you
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	they shall drag you in 
113.txt	shall they mr  rajah !
113.txt	said mary fiercely 
113.txt	i 'll sit and clench my teeth and never tell you one thing 
113.txt	i wo n't even look at you 
113.txt	i 'll stare at the floor !
113.txt	they may drag me in but they ca n't make me talk when they get me here 
113.txt	if they had been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other and had a rough and tumble fight 
113.txt	as it was they did the next thing to it
113.txt	you are a selfish thing !
113.txt	cried colin
113.txt	what are you ?
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	anyone is selfish who does n't do what they want 
113.txt	you 're more selfish than i am
113.txt	you 're the most selfish boy i ever saw 
113.txt	i 'm not !
113.txt	snapped colin
113.txt	he keeps you playing in the dirt when he knows i am all by myself 
113.txt	he 's selfish if you like !
113.txt	he 's nicer than any other boy that ever lived !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	he 's he 's like an angel !
113.txt	it might sound rather silly to say that but she did not care
113.txt	a nice angel !
113.txt	colin sneered ferociously 
113.txt	he 's a common cottage boy off the moor !
113.txt	he 's better than a common rajah !
113.txt	retorted mary 
113.txt	he 's a thousand times better !
113.txt	the truth was that he had never had a fight with anyone like himself in his life and upon the whole it was rather good for him though neither he nor mary knew anything about that 
113.txt	he turned his head on his pillow and shut his eyes and a big tear was squeezed out and ran down his cheek 
113.txt	he was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry for himself not for anyone else
113.txt	i 'm not as selfish as you because i 'm always ill and i 'm sure there is a lump coming on my back
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	and i am going to die besides 
113.txt	you 're not !
113.txt	contradicted mary unsympathetically
113.txt	he opened his eyes quite wide with indignation 
113.txt	he had never heard such a thing said before 
113.txt	he was at once furious and slightly pleased if a person could be both at one time
113.txt	i 'm not ?
113.txt	he cried 
113.txt	you know i am !
113.txt	everybody says so 
113.txt	i am !
113.txt	i do n't believe it !
113.txt	said mary sourly 
113.txt	i believe you 're proud of it 
113.txt	i do n't believe it !
113.txt	if you were a nice boy it might be true but you 're too nasty !
113.txt	you just say that to make people sorry
113.txt	get out of the room !
113.txt	he shouted and he caught hold of his pillow and threw it at her 
113.txt	he was not strong enough to throw it far and it only fell at her feet but mary 's face looked as pinched as a nutcracker
113.txt	i 'm going
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	and i wo n't come back !
113.txt	i was going to tell you all sorts of nice things
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	now i wo n't tell you a single thing !
113.txt	dickon brought his fox and his rook and i was going to tell you all about them 
113.txt	she was a big handsome young woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all as she could not bear invalids and she was always making excuses to leave colin to martha or anyone else who would take her place 
113.txt	mary had never liked her and she simply stood and gazed up at her as she stood giggling into her handkerchief
113.txt	what are you laughing at ?
113.txt	she asked her
113.txt	at you two young ones
113.txt	said the nurse 
113.txt	it 's the best thing that could happen to the sickly pampered thing to have someone to stand up to him that 's as spoiled as himself
113.txt	and she laughed into her handkerchief again 
113.txt	if he 'd had a young vixen of a sister to fight with it would have been the saving of him 
113.txt	is he going to die ?
113.txt	i do n't know and i do n't care
113.txt	said the nurse 
113.txt	hysterics and temper are half what ails him 
113.txt	what are hysterics ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	you 'll find out if you work him into a tantrum after this but at any rate you 've given him something to have hysterics about and i 'm glad of it 
113.txt	she was cross and disappointed but not at all sorry for colin 
113.txt	she had looked forward to telling him a great many things and she had meant to try to make up her mind whether it would be safe to trust him with the great secret 
113.txt	she had been beginning to think it would be but now she had changed her mind entirely 
113.txt	she would never tell him and he could stay in his room and never get any fresh air and die if he liked !
113.txt	it would serve him right !
113.txt	she felt so sour and unrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about dickon and the green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing down from the moor
113.txt	martha was waiting for her and the trouble in her face had been temporarily replaced by interest and curiosity 
113.txt	there was a wooden box on the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it was full of neat packages
113.txt	mr craven sent it to you
113.txt	said martha 
113.txt	it looks as if it had picture books in it
113.txt	do you want anything dolls toys books ?
113.txt	she opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll and also wondering what she should do with it if he had 
113.txt	but he had not sent one 
113.txt	there were several beautiful books such as colin had and two of them were about gardens and were full of pictures 
113.txt	there were two or three games and there was a beautiful little writing case with a gold monogram on it and a gold pen and inkstand
113.txt	everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out of her mind 
113.txt	she had not expected him to remember her at all and her hard little heart grew quite warm
113.txt	i can write better than i can print
113.txt	she said
113.txt	and the first thing i shall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him i am much obliged 
113.txt	he had a way of doing that which she could not bear 
113.txt	it gave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked so frightened himself 
113.txt	he said that if he felt even quite a little lump some day he should know his hunch had begun to grow 
113.txt	something he had heard mrs medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and he had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his mind 
113.txt	mrs medlock had said his father 's back had begun to show its crookedness in that way when he was a child 
113.txt	if she had been friends with colin she would have run to show him her presents at once and they would have looked at the pictures and read some of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games and he would have enjoyed himself so much he would never once have thought he was going to die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there was a lump coming  he had never told anyone but mary that most of his
113.txt	tantrums
113.txt	mary had been sorry for him when he had told her
113.txt	he always began to think about it when he was cross or tired
113.txt	she said to herself 
113.txt	perhaps perhaps he has been thinking about it all afternoon 
113.txt	and he has been cross today
113.txt	i said i would never go back again
113.txt	she hesitated knitting her brows
113.txt	perhaps he 'll try to throw his pillow at me again but i think i 'll go 
113.txt	but perhaps just perhaps i will go and see if he wants me in the morning 
113.txt	chapter xvii a tantrum she had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the garden and she was tired and sleepy so as soon as martha had brought her supper and she had eaten it she was glad to go to bed  as she laid her head on the pillow she murmured to herself
113.txt	i 'll go out before breakfast and work with dickon and then afterward i believe i 'll go to see him 
113.txt	what was it what was it ?
113.txt	the next minute she felt quite sure she knew 
113.txt	doors were opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors and someone was crying and screaming at the same time screaming and crying in a horrible way
113.txt	it 's colin
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	how awful it sounds 
113.txt	he 's having one of those tantrums the nurse called hysterics 
113.txt	she put her hands over her ears and felt sick and shivering
113.txt	i do n't know what to do  i do n't know what to do
113.txt	she kept saying 
113.txt	i ca n't bear it 
113.txt	even when she pressed her hands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful sounds out 
113.txt	she hated them so and was so terrified by them that suddenly they began to make her angry and she felt as if she should like to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him as he was frightening her 
113.txt	she was not used to anyone 's tempers but her own 
113.txt	she took her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot
113.txt	somebody ought to make him stop !
113.txt	he ought to be stopped ! somebody ought to beat him !
113.txt	she cried out
113.txt	just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her door opened and the nurse came in 
113.txt	she was not laughing now by any means
113.txt	she even looked rather pale
113.txt	he 's worked himself into hysterics
113.txt	she said in a great hurry 
113.txt	no one can do anything with him 
113.txt	you come and try like a good child 
113.txt	he likes you 
113.txt	he 'll do himself harm 
113.txt	he turned me out of the room this morning
113.txt	the stamp rather pleased the nurse 
113.txt	the truth was that she had been afraid she might find mary crying and hiding her head under the bed clothes
113.txt	that 's right
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	you go and scold him 
113.txt	give him something new to think of 
113.txt	do go child as quick as ever you can 
113.txt	you 're in the right humor
113.txt	she flew along the corridor and the nearer she got to the screams the higher her temper mounted 
113.txt	she felt quite wicked by the time she reached the door 
113.txt	she slapped it open with her hand and ran across the room to the four posted bed
113.txt	you stop !
113.txt	she almost shouted 
113.txt	i hate you !
113.txt	everybody hates you !
113.txt	i wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream yourself to death !
113.txt	you will scream yourself to death in a minute and i wish you would !
113.txt	you stop !
113.txt	he had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and he actually almost jumped around he turned so quickly at the sound of the furious little voice 
113.txt	his face looked dreadful white and red and swollen and he was gasping and choking
113.txt	but savage little mary did not care an atom
113.txt	if you scream another scream
113.txt	she said
113.txt	i 'll scream too and i can scream louder than you can and i 'll frighten you i 'll frighten you !
113.txt	the scream which had been coming almost choked him 
113.txt	the tears were streaming down his face and he shook all over
113.txt	i ca n't stop !
113.txt	he gasped and sobbed 
113.txt	i ca n't i ca n't !
113.txt	you can !
113.txt	shouted mary 
113.txt	half that ails you is hysterics and temper just hysterics hysterics hysterics !
113.txt	and she stamped each time she said it
113.txt	i felt the lump i felt it
113.txt	choked out colin 
113.txt	i knew i should  i shall have a hunch on my back and then i shall die
113.txt	you did n't feel a lump !
113.txt	contradicted mary fiercely 
113.txt	hysterics makes lumps 
113.txt	there 's nothing the matter with your horrid back nothing but hysterics !
113.txt	turn over and let me look at it !
113.txt	if you did it was only a hysterical lump 
113.txt	she liked the word
113.txt	hysterics
113.txt	he was probably like herself and had never heard it before
113.txt	nurse
113.txt	she commanded
113.txt	come here and show me his back this minute !
113.txt	all three had gasped with fright more than once 
113.txt	the nurse came forward as if she were half afraid 
113.txt	colin was heaving with great breathless sobs
113.txt	perhaps he he wo n't let me
113.txt	colin heard her however and he gasped out between two sobs
113.txt	she she 'll see then !
113.txt	sh show her !
113.txt	every rib could be counted and every joint of the spine though mistress mary did not count them as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage little face 
113.txt	she looked so sour and old fashioned that the nurse turned her head aside to hide the twitching of her mouth 
113.txt	there was just a minute 's silence for even colin tried to hold his breath while mary looked up and down his spine and down and up as intently as if she had been the great doctor from london
113.txt	there 's not a single lump there !
113.txt	she said at last 
113.txt	i 've got backbone lumps myself and they used to stick out as much as yours do until i began to get fatter and i am not fat enough yet to hide them 
113.txt	there 's not a lump as big as a pin !
113.txt	if you ever say there is again i shall laugh !
113.txt	there 's not a lump as big as a pin except backbone lumps and you can only feel them because you 're thin 
113.txt	if he had ever had anyone to talk to about his secret terrors if he had ever dared to let himself ask questions if he had had childish companions and had not lain on his back in the huge closed house breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who were most of them ignorant and tired of him he would have found out that most of his fright and illness was created by himself 
113.txt	but he had lain and thought of himself and his aches and weariness for hours and days and months and years 
113.txt	and now that an angry unsympathetic little girl insisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was he actually felt as if she might be speaking the truth
113.txt	i did n't know
113.txt	ventured the nurse
113.txt	his back is weak because he wo n't try to sit up 
113.txt	that he thought he had a lump on his spine  i could have told him there was no lump there
113.txt	colin gulped and turned his face a little to look at her
113.txt	c could you ?
113.txt	he said pathetically
113.txt	yes sir
113.txt	there !
113.txt	said mary and she gulped too
113.txt	colin turned on his face again and but for his long drawn broken breaths which were the dying down of his storm of sobbing he lay still for a minute though great tears streamed down his face and wet the pillow 
113.txt	actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had come to him 
113.txt	presently he turned and looked at the nurse again and strangely enough he was not like a rajah at all as he spoke to her
113.txt	do you think i could live to grow up ?
113.txt	he said
113.txt	the nurse was neither clever nor soft hearted but she could repeat some of the london doctor 's words
113.txt	you probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give way to your temper and stay out a great deal in the fresh air 
113.txt	he put out his hand a little toward mary and i am glad to say that her own tantum having passed she was softened too and met him half way with her hand so that it was a sort of making up
113.txt	i 'll i 'll go out with you mary
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i sha n't hate fresh air if we can find
113.txt	he remembered just in time to stop himself from saying
113.txt	if we can find the secret garden
113.txt	and he ended
113.txt	i do so want to see dickon and the fox and the crow 
113.txt	i shall like to go out with you if dickon will come and push my chair 
113.txt	then she made colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to mary who really was very glad to get it after her excitement 
113.txt	mrs medlock and martha gladly slipped away and after everything was neat and calm and in order the nurse looked as if she would very gladly slip away also 
113.txt	she was a healthy young woman who resented being robbed of her sleep and she yawned quite openly as she looked at mary who had pushed her big footstool close to the four posted bed and was holding colin 's hand
113.txt	you must go back and get your sleep out
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	then i 'll lie down myself in the next room 
113.txt	he 'll drop off after a while if he 's not too upset 
113.txt	would you like me to sing you that song i learned from my ayah ?
113.txt	mary whispered to colin
113.txt	his hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired eyes on her appealingly
113.txt	oh yes !
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	i shall go to sleep in a minute 
113.txt	it 's such a soft song 
113.txt	i will put him to sleep
113.txt	mary said to the yawning nurse 
113.txt	you can go if you like 
113.txt	well
113.txt	said the nurse with an attempt at reluctance 
113.txt	if he does n't go to sleep in half an hour you must call me 
113.txt	very well
113.txt	the nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was gone colin pulled mary 's hand again
113.txt	i almost told
113.txt	he said
113.txt	i wo n't talk and i 'll go to sleep but you said you had a whole lot of nice things to tell me 
113.txt	have you do you think you have found out anything at all about the way into the secret garden ?
113.txt	but i stopped myself in time
113.txt	ye es
113.txt	she answered
113.txt	i think i have  and if you will go to sleep i will tell you tomorrow
113.txt	his hand quite trembled
113.txt	oh mary !
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	if i could get into it i think i should live to grow up !
113.txt	do you suppose that instead of singing the ayah song you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what you imagine it looks like inside ?
113.txt	i am sure it will make me go to sleep 
113.txt	oh mary !
113.txt	yes
113.txt	answered mary 
113.txt	shut your eyes
113.txt	i think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the ground almost like a strange gray mist 
113.txt	some of them have died but many are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains and fountains of roses 
113.txt	i think the ground is full of daffodils and snowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark 
113.txt	i think it has been left alone so long that it has grown all into a lovely tangle  now the spring has begun perhaps perhaps
113.txt	perhaps the leaves are beginning to break out and uncurl and perhaps the gray is changing and a green gauze veil is creeping and creeping over everything 
113.txt	and the birds are coming to look at it because it is so safe and still 
113.txt	perhaps they are coming up through the grass perhaps there are clusters of purple crocuses and gold ones even now  and perhaps perhaps perhaps
113.txt	very softly and slowly indeed
113.txt	the robin has found a mate and is building a nest
113.txt	chapter xviii
113.txt	tha
113.txt	munnot waste no time
113.txt	she slept late because she was tired and when martha brought her breakfast she told her that though colin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he always was after he had worn himself out with a fit of crying 
113.txt	mary ate her breakfast slowly as she listened
113.txt	he says he wishes tha
113.txt	would please go and see him as soon as tha
113.txt	can
113.txt	martha said 
113.txt	it 's queer what a fancy he 's took to thee  tha
113.txt	nobody else would have dared to do it 
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	poor lad !
113.txt	he 's been spoiled till salt wo n't save him 
113.txt	did give it him last night for sure did n't tha ? mother says as th
113.txt	two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own way or always to have it  she does n't know which is th
113.txt	worst  tha
113.txt	was in a fine temper thaself too  but he says to me when i went into his room please ask miss mary if she 'll please come an
113.txt	talk to me ?
113.txt	think o
113.txt	will you go miss ?
113.txt	him saying please !
113.txt	i 'll run and see dickon first
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	no i 'll go and see colin first and tell him i know what i 'll tell him
113.txt	she had her hat on when she appeared in colin 's room and for a second he looked disappointed 
113.txt	he was in bed 
113.txt	his face was pitifully white and there were dark circles round his eyes
113.txt	i 'm glad you came
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	are you going somewhere ?
113.txt	my head aches and i ache all over because i 'm so tired
113.txt	i wo n't be long
113.txt	she said
113.txt	colin it 's it 's something about the garden
113.txt	oh ! is it ?
113.txt	he cried out 
113.txt	i heard you say something about gray changing into green and i dreamed i was standing in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves and there were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still
113.txt	i 'll lie and think about it until you come back 
113.txt	the fox and the crow were with him again and this time he had brought two tame squirrels
113.txt	i came over on the pony this mornin
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	he is a good little chap jump is !
113.txt	i brought these two in my pockets 
113.txt	eh ! this here one he 's called nut an
113.txt	this here other one 's called shell 
113.txt	when he said
113.txt	nut
113.txt	one squirrel leaped on to his right shoulder and when he said
113.txt	shell
113.txt	when they sat down on the grass with captain curled at their feet soot solemnly listening on a tree and nut and shell nosing about close to them it seemed to mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave such delightfulness but when she began to tell her story somehow the look in dickon 's funny face gradually changed her mind 
113.txt	she could see he felt sorrier for colin than she did 
113.txt	he looked up at the sky and all about him
113.txt	just listen to them birds th
113.txt	world seems full of em all whistlin
113.txt	an
113.txt	pipin
113.txt	he said

113.txt	my word th
113.txt	nice smells there is about !
113.txt	sniffing with his happy turned up nose

113.txt	that poor lad lyin

113.txt	seein
113.txt	so little that he gets to thinkin

113.txt	get him just soaked through wi
113.txt	sunshine  an
113.txt	we munnot lose no time about it 
113.txt	but she loved his broad yorkshire and had in fact been trying to learn to speak it herself 
113.txt	so she spoke a little now
113.txt	aye that we mun
113.txt	she said which meant
113.txt	yes indeed we must
113.txt	i 'll tell thee what us 'll do first
113.txt	she proceeded and dickon grinned because when the little wench tried to twist her tongue into speaking yorkshire it amused him very much 
113.txt	he 's took a graidely fancy to thee  he wants to see thee and he wants to see soot an
113.txt	when i go back to the house to talk to him i 'll ax him if tha
113.txt	canna
113.txt	come an

113.txt	we 'll bring him here an
113.txt	show him everything 
113.txt	she had never made a long speech in yorkshire before and she had remembered very well
113.txt	tha
113.txt	mun talk a bit o
113.txt	yorkshire like that to mester colin
113.txt	dickon chuckled 
113.txt	tha 'll make him laugh an
113.txt	there 's nowt as good for ill folk as laughin
113.txt	is  mother says she believes as half a hour 's good laugh every mornin
113.txt	ud cure a chap as was makin
113.txt	ready for typhus fever 
113.txt	i 'm going to talk yorkshire to him this very day
113.txt	the garden had reached the time when every day and every night it seemed as if magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out of the earth and the boughs with wands 
113.txt	it was hard to go away and leave it all particularly as nut had actually crept on to her dress and shell had scrambled down the trunk of the apple tree they sat under and stayed there looking at her with inquiring eyes 
113.txt	but she went back to the house and when she sat down close to colin 's bed he began to sniff as dickon did though not in such an experienced way
113.txt	you smell like flowers and and fresh things
113.txt	he cried out quite joyously 
113.txt	it 's cool and warm and sweet all at the same time 
113.txt	what is it you smell of ?
113.txt	it 's th
113.txt	wind from th
113.txt	moor
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	it comes o
113.txt	sittin
113.txt	on th
113.txt	grass under a tree wi
113.txt	dickon an
113.txt	wi

113.txt	springtime an
113.txt	out o
113.txt	doors an
113.txt	sunshine as smells so graidely 
113.txt	colin began to laugh
113.txt	what are you doing ?
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	how funny it sounds 
113.txt	i never heard you talk like that before 
113.txt	i 'm givin
113.txt	thee a bit o
113.txt	yorkshire
113.txt	answered mary triumphantly 
113.txt	i canna
113.txt	talk as graidely as dickon an
113.txt	martha can but tha
113.txt	sees i can shape a bit  does n't tha
113.txt	understand a bit o
113.txt	yorkshire when tha
113.txt	hears it ? an
113.txt	tha
113.txt	a yorkshire lad thysel
113.txt	bred an
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	born ! i wonder thart not ashamed o
113.txt	thy face
113.txt	medlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed
113.txt	well upon my word !
113.txt	she said speaking rather broad yorkshire herself because there was no one to hear her and she was so astonished
113.txt	whoever heard th
113.txt	like ! whoever on earth would ha
113.txt	thought it !
113.txt	it seemed as if colin could never hear enough of dickon and captain and soot and nut and shell and the pony whose name was jump 
113.txt	mary had run round into the wood with dickon to see jump 
113.txt	he was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks hanging over his eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose 
113.txt	he was rather thin with living on moor grass but he was as tough and wiry as if the muscle in his little legs had been made of steel springs 
113.txt	he had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment he saw dickon and he had trotted up to him and put his head across his shoulder and then dickon had talked into his ear and jump had talked back in odd little whinnies and puffs and snorts 
113.txt	dickon had made him give mary his small front hoof and kiss her on her cheek with his velvet muzzle
113.txt	does he really understand everything dickon says ?
113.txt	colin asked
113.txt	it seems as if he does
113.txt	answered mary 
113.txt	dickon says anything will understand if you 're friends with it for sure but you have to be friends for sure
113.txt	i wish i was friends with things
113.txt	he said at last
113.txt	i never had anything to be friends with and i ca n't bear people 
113.txt	but i 'm not 
113.txt	ca n't you bear me ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	yes i can
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	it 's funny but i even like you 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff said i was like him
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	i think you are like him too 
113.txt	we are all three alike you and i and ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	he said we were neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked
113.txt	but i do n't feel as sour as i used to before i knew the robin and dickon 
113.txt	did you feel as if you hated people ?
113.txt	yes
113.txt	answered mary without any affectation 
113.txt	i should have detested you if i had seen you before i saw the robin and dickon
113.txt	mary
113.txt	he said
113.txt	i hated you when you said he was like an angel and i laughed at you but but perhaps he is 
113.txt	i wish i had n't said what i did about sending dickon away 
113.txt	well it was rather funny to say it
113.txt	she admitted frankly
113.txt	because his nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes have patches all over them and he talks broad yorkshire but but if an angel did come to yorkshire and live on the moor if there was a yorkshire angel i believe he 'd understand the green things and know how to make them grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as dickon does and they 'd know he was friends for sure 
113.txt	i should n't mind dickon looking at me
113.txt	said colin
113.txt	i want to see him 
113.txt	i 'm glad you said that
113.txt	answered mary
113.txt	because because
113.txt	colin knew something new was coming
113.txt	because what ?
113.txt	he cried eagerly
113.txt	mary was so anxious that she got up from her stool and came to him and caught hold of both his hands
113.txt	i trusted dickon because birds trusted him 
113.txt	can i trust you ? can i trust you for sure for sure ?
113.txt	her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer
113.txt	yes yes !
113.txt	well dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning and he 'll bring his creatures with him
113.txt	oh ! oh !
113.txt	colin cried out in delight
113.txt	but that 's not all
113.txt	there is a door into the garden 
113.txt	i found it 
113.txt	it is under the ivy on the wall 
113.txt	the rest is better 
113.txt	if he had been a strong healthy boy colin would probably have shouted
113.txt	hooray !
113.txt	hooray ! hooray !
113.txt	but he was weak and rather hysterical
113.txt	his eyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath
113.txt	oh ! mary !
113.txt	he cried out with a half sob 
113.txt	shall i get into it ?
113.txt	shall i see it ? shall i live to get into it ?
113.txt	and he clutched her hands and dragged her toward him
113.txt	of course you 'll see it !
113.txt	snapped mary indignantly 
113.txt	do n't be silly !
113.txt	of course you 'll live to get into it !
113.txt	it is just what you thought it would be
113.txt	he said at last 
113.txt	you know i said that when you told me first 
113.txt	it sounds just as if you had really seen it
113.txt	i had seen it and i had been in
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i found the key and got in weeks ago  but i dare n't tell you i dare n't because i was so afraid i could n't trust you for sure !
113.txt	chapter xix
113.txt	it has come !
113.txt	he was always sent for at once when such a thing occurred and he always found when he arrived a white shaken boy lying on his bed sulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break into fresh sobbing at the least word 
113.txt	in fact dr craven dreaded and detested the difficulties of these visits 
113.txt	on this occasion he was away from misselthwaite manor until afternoon
113.txt	how is he ?
113.txt	he asked mrs medlock rather irritably when he arrived
113.txt	the boy is half insane with hysteria and self indulgence 
113.txt	he will break a blood vessel in one of those fits some day 
113.txt	well sir
113.txt	answered mrs medlock
113.txt	that plain sour faced child that 's almost as bad as himself has just bewitched him 
113.txt	how she 's done it there 's no telling
113.txt	the lord knows she 's nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her speak but she did what none of us dare do 
113.txt	she just flew at him like a little cat last night and stamped her feet and ordered him to stop screaming and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop and this afternoon well just come up and see sir 
113.txt	it 's past crediting 
113.txt	as mrs medlock opened the door he heard laughing and chattering 
113.txt	colin was on his sofa in his dressing gown and he was sitting up quite straight looking at a picture in one of the garden books and talking to the plain child who at that moment could scarcely be called plain at all because her face was so glowing with enjoyment
113.txt	those long spires of blue ones we 'll have a lot of those
113.txt	colin was announcing 
113.txt	they 're called del phin iums 
113.txt	dickon says they 're larkspurs made big and grand
113.txt	cried mistress mary 
113.txt	there are clumps there already 
113.txt	mary became quite still and colin looked fretful
113.txt	i am sorry to hear you were ill last night my boy
113.txt	he was rather a nervous man
113.txt	i 'm better now much better
113.txt	colin answered rather like a rajah 
113.txt	i 'm going out in my chair in a day or two if it is fine  i want some fresh air
113.txt	craven sat down by him and felt his pulse and looked at him curiously
113.txt	it must be a very fine day
113.txt	he said
113.txt	and you must be very careful not to tire yourself 
113.txt	fresh air wo n't tire me
113.txt	as there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shrieked aloud with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him cold and kill him it is not to be wondered at that his doctor felt somewhat startled
113.txt	i thought you did not like fresh air
113.txt	i do n't when i am by myself
113.txt	replied the rajah
113.txt	but my cousin is going out with me 
113.txt	and the nurse of course ?
113.txt	suggested dr craven
113.txt	no i will not have the nurse
113.txt	i am always better when she is with me 
113.txt	she made me better last night 
113.txt	my cousin knows how to take care of me  a very strong boy i know will push my carriage
113.txt	craven felt rather alarmed 
113.txt	if this tiresome hysterical boy should chance to get well he himself would lose all chance of inheriting misselthwaite
113.txt	but he was not an unscrupulous man though he was a weak one and he did not intend to let him run into actual danger
113.txt	he must be a strong boy and a steady boy
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	who is he ?
113.txt	what is his name ?
113.txt	and i must know something about him 
113.txt	it 's dickon
113.txt	she felt somehow that everybody who knew the moor must know dickon 
113.txt	and she was right too 
113.txt	she saw that in a moment dr craven 's serious face relaxed into a relieved smile
113.txt	oh dickon
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	he 's as strong as a moor pony is dickon 
113.txt	if it is dickon you will be safe enough 
113.txt	and he 's trusty
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	he 's th
113.txt	trustiest lad i
113.txt	yorkshire
113.txt	did dickon teach you that ?
113.txt	asked dr craven laughing outright
113.txt	i 'm learning it as if it was french
113.txt	said mary rather coldly 
113.txt	very clever people try to learn them 
113.txt	i like it and so does colin 
113.txt	it 's like a native dialect in india 
113.txt	well well
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	did you take your bromide last night colin ?
113.txt	if it amuses you perhaps it wo n't do you any harm 
113.txt	no
113.txt	colin answered 
113.txt	i would n't take it at first and after mary made me quiet she talked me to sleep in a low voice about the spring creeping into a garden 
113.txt	that sounds soothing
113.txt	said dr craven more perplexed than ever and glancing sideways at mistress mary sitting on her stool and looking down silently at the carpet 
113.txt	you are evidently better but you must remember
113.txt	i do n't want to remember
FAILURE with line [113.txt	963], exception: ValueError('not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)',)
113.txt	if there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill instead of remembering it i would have him brought here
113.txt	and he waved a thin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signet rings made of rubies 
113.txt	it is because my cousin makes me forget that she makes me better
113.txt	dr  craven had never made such a short stay after a
113.txt	tantrum
113.txt	this afternoon he did not give any medicine or leave any new orders and he was spared any disagreeable scenes 
113.txt	when he went downstairs he looked very thoughtful and when he talked to mrs medlock in the library she felt that he was a much puzzled man
113.txt	well sir
113.txt	she ventured
113.txt	could you have believed it ?
113.txt	it is certainly a new state of affairs
113.txt	said the doctor 
113.txt	and there 's no denying it is better than the old one 
113.txt	i believe susan sowerby 's right i do that
113.txt	said mrs medlock 
113.txt	i stopped in her cottage on my way to thwaite yesterday and had a bit of talk with her  and she says to me well sarah ann she may n't be a good child an
113.txt	she may n't be a pretty one but she 's a child an
113.txt	we went to school together susan sowerby and me 
113.txt	children needs children
113.txt	she 's the best sick nurse i know
113.txt	said dr craven 
113.txt	when i find her in a cottage i know the chances are that i shall save my patient
113.txt	medlock smiled 
113.txt	she was fond of susan sowerby
113.txt	she 's got a way with her has susan
113.txt	she went on quite volubly 
113.txt	i 've been thinking all morning of one thing she said yesterday  she says once when i was givin
113.txt	th
113.txt	children a bit of a preach after they 'd been fightin
113.txt	i ses to em all
113.txt	when i was at school my jography told as th
113.txt	world was shaped like a orange an
113.txt	i found out before i was ten that th
113.txt	whole orange does n't belong to nobody  no one owns more than his bit of a quarter an
113.txt	there 's times it seems like there 's not enow quarters to go round  but do n't you none o
113.txt	you think as you own th
113.txt	whole orange or you 'll find out you 're mistaken an
113.txt	you wo n't find it out without hard knocks
113.txt	what children learns from children
113.txt	she says is that there 's no sense in grabbin
113.txt	at th
113.txt	whole orange peel an
113.txt	all  if you do you 'll likely not get even th
113.txt	pips an
113.txt	them 's too bitter to eat 
113.txt	she 's a shrewd woman
113.txt	well she 's got a way of saying things
113.txt	ended mrs medlock much pleased 
113.txt	sometimes i 've said to her eh ! susan if you was a different woman an
113.txt	did n't talk such broad yorkshire i 've seen the times when i should have said you was clever 
113.txt	it was actually nice to be awake and he turned over and stretched his limbs luxuriously 
113.txt	he felt as if tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves and let him go 
113.txt	he did not know that dr craven would have said that his nerves had relaxed and rested themselves 
113.txt	instead of lying and staring at the wall and wishing he had not awakened his mind was full of the plans he and mary had made yesterday of pictures of the garden and of dickon and his wild creatures 
113.txt	it was so nice to have things to think about
113.txt	and he had not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet running along the corridor and mary was at the door 
113.txt	the next minute she was in the room and had run across to his bed bringing with her a waft of fresh air full of the scent of the morning
113.txt	you 've been out !
113.txt	there 's that nice smell of leaves !
113.txt	you 've been out !
113.txt	she had been running and her hair was loose and blown and she was bright with the air and pink cheeked though he could not see it
113.txt	it 's so beautiful !
113.txt	she said a little breathless with her speed 
113.txt	it has come !
113.txt	i thought it had come that other morning but it was only coming 
113.txt	it is here now !
113.txt	it has come the spring !
113.txt	dickon says so !
113.txt	you never saw anything so beautiful !
113.txt	has it ?
113.txt	cried colin and though he really knew nothing about it he felt his heart beat 
113.txt	he actually sat up in bed
113.txt	open the window !
113.txt	he added laughing half with joyful excitement and half at his own fancy 
113.txt	perhaps we may hear golden trumpets !
113.txt	and though he laughed mary was at the window in a moment and in a moment more it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents and birds
113.txt	that 's fresh air
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	that 's what dickon does when he 's lying on the moor 
113.txt	he says he feels it in his veins and it makes him strong and he feels as if he could live forever and ever 
113.txt	breathe it and breathe it 
113.txt	lie on your back and draw in long breaths of it
113.txt	forever and ever
113.txt	! does it make him feel like that ?
113.txt	he said and he did as she told him drawing in long deep breaths over and over again until he felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to him
113.txt	mary was at his bedside again
113.txt	things are crowding up out of the earth
113.txt	she ran on in a hurry 
113.txt	and the rose bushes look as wick as wick can be and there are primroses in the lanes and woods and the seeds we planted are up and dickon has brought the fox and the crow and the squirrels and a new born lamb 
113.txt	and there are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veil has covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about their nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even fighting for places in the secret garden 
113.txt	the new born lamb dickon had found three days before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on the moor 
113.txt	it was not the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew what to do with it 
113.txt	he had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he had let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk 
113.txt	it was a soft thing with a darling silly baby face and legs rather long for its body 
113.txt	dickon had carried it over the moor in his arms and its feeding bottle was in his pocket with a squirrel and when mary had sat under a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her lap she had felt as if she were too full of strange joy to speak 
113.txt	a lamb a lamb !
113.txt	a living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby !
113.txt	she was describing it with great joy and colin was listening and drawing in long breaths of air when the nurse entered 
113.txt	she started a little at the sight of the open window 
113.txt	she had sat stifling in the room many a warm day because her patient was sure that open windows gave people cold
113.txt	are you sure you are not chilly master colin ?
113.txt	she inquired
113.txt	no
113.txt	was the answer 
113.txt	it makes you strong 
113.txt	i am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast 
113.txt	my cousin will have breakfast with me 
113.txt	i am breathing long breaths of fresh air 
113.txt	the nurse went away concealing a smile to give the order for two breakfasts  she found the servants
113.txt	hall a more amusing place than the invalid 's chamber and just now everybody wanted to hear the news from upstairs  there was a great deal of joking about the unpopular young recluse who as the cook said
113.txt	had found his master and good for him
113.txt	the servants
113.txt	hall had been very tired of the tantrums and the butler who was a man with a family had more than once expressed his opinion that the invalid would be all the better
113.txt	for a good hiding
113.txt	a boy and a fox and a crow and two squirrels and a new born lamb are coming to see me this morning  i want them brought upstairs as soon as they come
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	you are not to begin playing with the animals in the servants
113.txt	i want them here 
113.txt	hall and keep them there
113.txt	yes sir
113.txt	i 'll tell you what you can do
113.txt	added colin waving his hand 
113.txt	the boy is martha 's brother 
113.txt	his name is dickon and he is an animal charmer 
113.txt	you can tell martha to bring them here 
113.txt	i hope the animals wo n't bite master colin
113.txt	i told you he was a charmer
113.txt	said colin austerely 
113.txt	charmers
113.txt	animals never bite 
113.txt	there are snake charmers in india
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	and they can put their snakes
113.txt	heads in their mouths
113.txt	goodness !
113.txt	shuddered the nurse
113.txt	they ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them
113.txt	colin 's breakfast was a very good one and mary watched him with serious interest
113.txt	you will begin to get fatter just as i did
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i never wanted my breakfast when i was in india and now i always want it 
113.txt	i wanted mine this morning
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	when do you think dickon will come ?
113.txt	perhaps it was the fresh air 
113.txt	in about ten minutes mary held up her hand
113.txt	listen !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	did you hear a caw ?
113.txt	colin listened and heard it the oddest sound in the world to hear inside a house a hoarse
113.txt	caw caw 
113.txt	yes
113.txt	that 's soot
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	do you hear a bleat a tiny one ?
113.txt	listen again 
113.txt	oh yes !
113.txt	cried colin quite flushing
113.txt	that 's the new born lamb
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	he 's coming 
113.txt	mary and colin heard him marching marching until he passed through the tapestry door on to the soft carpet of colin 's own passage
113.txt	if you please sir
113.txt	announced martha opening the door
113.txt	if you please sir here 's dickon an
113.txt	his creatures 
113.txt	the new born lamb was in his arms and the little red fox trotted by his side 
113.txt	nut sat on his left shoulder and soot on his right and shell 's head and paws peeped out of his coat pocket
113.txt	colin slowly sat up and stared and stared as he had stared when he first saw mary
113.txt	but this was a stare of wonder and delight 
113.txt	the truth was that in spite of all he had heard he had not in the least understood what this boy would be like and that his fox and his crow and his squirrels and his lamb were so near to him and his friendliness that they seemed almost to be part of himself 
113.txt	colin had never talked to a boy in his life and he was so overwhelmed by his own pleasure and curiosity that he did not even think of speaking
113.txt	but dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward 
113.txt	he had not felt embarrassed because the crow had not known his language and had only stared and had not spoken to him the first time they met 
113.txt	creatures were always like that until they found out about you 
113.txt	he walked over to colin 's sofa and put the new born lamb quietly on his lap and immediately the little creature turned to the warm velvet dressing gown and began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight curled head with soft impatience against his side 
113.txt	of course no boy could have helped speaking then
113.txt	what is it doing ?
113.txt	cried colin 
113.txt	what does it want ?
113.txt	it wants its mother
113.txt	said dickon smiling more and more 
113.txt	i brought it to thee a bit hungry because i knowed tha 'd like to see it feed
113.txt	come on little un
113.txt	he said turning the small woolly white head with a gentle brown hand 
113.txt	this is what tha 's after  tha 'll get more out o
113.txt	this than tha
113.txt	will out o
113.txt	silk velvet coats  there now
113.txt	after that there was no wondering what to say 
113.txt	by the time the lamb fell asleep questions poured forth and dickon answered them all 
113.txt	he told them how he had found the lamb just as the sun was rising three mornings ago 
113.txt	he had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark and watching him swing higher and higher into the sky until he was only a speck in the heights of blue
113.txt	i 'd almost lost him but for his song an
113.txt	i was wonderin
113.txt	how a chap could hear it when it seemed as if he 'd get out o
113.txt	th
113.txt	world in a minute an
113.txt	just then i heard somethin
113.txt	else far off among th
113.txt	gorse bushes  it was a weak bleatin
113.txt	an
113.txt	i knowed it was a new lamb as was hungry an
113.txt	i knowed it would n't be hungry if it had n't lost its mother somehow so i set off searchin
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	i did have a look for it 
113.txt	 i went in an
113.txt	out among th
113.txt	gorse bushes an
113.txt	round an
113.txt	round an
113.txt	i always seemed to take th
113.txt	wrong turnin
113.txt	 but at last i seed a bit o
113.txt	white by a rock on top o
113.txt	th
113.txt	moor an
113.txt	i climbed up an
113.txt	found th
113.txt	little un half dead wi
113.txt	cold an
113.txt	clemmin
113.txt	
113.txt	captain curled up near dickon who sat on the hearth rug from preference
113.txt	they looked at the pictures in the gardening books and dickon knew all the flowers by their country names and knew exactly which ones were already growing in the secret garden
113.txt	i couldna
113.txt	say that there name
113.txt	he said pointing to one under which was written
113.txt	aquilegia
113.txt	but us calls that a columbine an
113.txt	that there one it 's a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges but these is garden ones an
113.txt	they 're bigger an
113.txt	grander  there 's some big clumps o
113.txt	columbine in th
113.txt	garden  they 'll look like a bed o
113.txt	blue an
113.txt	white butterflies flutterin
113.txt	when they 're out 
113.txt	i 'm going to see them
113.txt	cried colin 
113.txt	i am going to see them !
113.txt	aye that tha
113.txt	mun
113.txt	said mary quite seriously 
113.txt	an
113.txt	tha
113.txt	munnot lose no time about it 
113.txt	chapter xx
113.txt	i shall live forever and ever and ever !
113.txt	but they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came some very windy days and then colin was threatened with a cold which two things happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him into a rage but that there was so much careful and mysterious planning to do and almost every day dickon came in if only for a few minutes to talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and hedges and on the borders of streams  the things he had to tell about otters
113.txt	and badgers
113.txt	and water rats
113.txt	houses not to mention birds
113.txt	they 're same as us
113.txt	said dickon
113.txt	only they have to build their homes every year  an
113.txt	it keeps em so busy they fair scuffle to get em done 
113.txt	no one must see the chair carriage and dickon and mary after they turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside the ivied walls 
113.txt	as each day passed colin had become more and more fixed in his feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was one of its greatest charms 
113.txt	nothing must spoil that 
113.txt	no one must ever suspect that they had a secret 
113.txt	people must think that he was simply going out with mary and dickon because he liked them and did not object to their looking at him 
113.txt	they had long and quite delightful talks about their route 
113.txt	the most absorbing thing however was the preparations to be made before colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the garden  they would go up this path and down that one and cross the other and go round among the fountain flower beds as if they were looking at the
113.txt	bedding out plants
113.txt	that would seem such a rational thing to do that no one would think it at all mysterious 
113.txt	they would turn into the shrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls
113.txt	it was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of march made by great generals in time of war
113.txt	rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the invalid 's apartments had of course filtered through the servants
113.txt	well well
113.txt	he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat
113.txt	what 's to do now ? his royal highness that was n't to be looked at calling up a man he 's never set eyes on
113.txt	roach was not without curiosity 
113.txt	he had never caught even a glimpse of the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his uncanny looks and ways and his insane tempers 
113.txt	the thing he had heard oftenest was that he might die at any moment and there had been numerous fanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs given by people who had never seen him
113.txt	things are changing in this house mr roach
113.txt	let 's hope they 're changing for the better mrs medlock
113.txt	they could n't well change for the worse
113.txt	she continued
113.txt	do n't you be surprised mr roach if you find yourself in the middle of a menagerie and martha sowerby 's dickon more at home than you or me could ever be 
113.txt	and queer as it all is there 's them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand up under 
113.txt	when mr roach heard his name he smiled quite leniently
113.txt	he 'd be at home in buckingham palace or at the bottom of a coal mine
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	he 's just fine is that lad 
113.txt	and yet it 's not impudence either 
113.txt	it was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might have been startled  when the bedroom door was opened a large crow which seemed quite at home perched on the high back of a carven chair announced the entrance of a visitor by saying
113.txt	caw caw
113.txt	in spite of mrs 
113.txt	medlock 's warning mr roach only just escaped being sufficiently undignified to jump backward
113.txt	the young rajah was neither in bed nor on his sofa 
113.txt	he was sitting in an armchair and a young lamb was standing by him shaking its tail in feeding lamb fashion as dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle 
113.txt	a squirrel was perched on dickon 's bent back attentively nibbling a nut
113.txt	the little girl from india was sitting on a big footstool looking on
113.txt	here is mr roach master colin
113.txt	the young rajah turned and looked his servitor over at least that was what the head gardener felt happened
113.txt	oh you are roach are you ?
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i sent for you to give you some very important orders 
113.txt	very good sir
113.txt	i am going out in my chair this afternoon
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	when i go none of the gardeners are to be anywhere near the long walk by the garden walls 
113.txt	no one is to be there 
113.txt	i shall go out about two oclock and everyone must keep away until i send word that they may go back to their work 
113.txt	if the fresh air agrees with me i may go out every day 
113.txt	very good sir
113.txt	mary
113.txt	said colin turning to her
113.txt	what is that thing you say in india when you have finished talking and want people to go ?
113.txt	you say you have my permission to go
113.txt	the rajah waved his hand
113.txt	you have my permission to go roach
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	but remember this is very important
113.txt	caw caw !
113.txt	remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely
113.txt	very good sir  thank you sir
113.txt	outside in the corridor being a rather good natured man he smiled until he almost laughed
113.txt	my word !
113.txt	he said
113.txt	you 'd think he was a whole royal family rolled into one prince consort and all
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	protested mrs medlock
113.txt	we 've had to let him trample all over everyone of us ever since he had feet and he thinks that 's what folks was born for 
113.txt	perhaps he 'll grow out of it if he lives
113.txt	well there 's one thing pretty sure
113.txt	said mrs medlock 
113.txt	and he 'll be likely to find out the size of his own quarter 
113.txt	if he does live and that indian child stays here i 'll warrant she teaches him that the whole orange does not belong to him as susan sowerby says
113.txt	it 's all safe now
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	and this afternoon i shall see it this afternoon i shall be in it !
113.txt	she did not think he looked tired but he was very quiet before their lunch came and he was quiet while they were eating it 
113.txt	she wondered why and asked him about it
113.txt	what big eyes you 've got colin
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	what are you thinking about now ?
113.txt	when you are thinking they get as big as saucers 
113.txt	i ca n't help thinking about what it will look like
113.txt	the garden ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	the springtime
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i scarcely ever went out and when i did go i never looked at it 
113.txt	i did n't even think about it 
113.txt	i was thinking that i 've really never seen it before 
113.txt	i never saw it in india because there was n't any
113.txt	shut in and morbid as his life had been colin had more imagination than she had and at least he had spent a good deal of time looking at wonderful books and pictures
113.txt	it 's come !
113.txt	you made me feel quite queer 
113.txt	it sounded as if things were coming with a great procession and big bursts and wafts of music 
113.txt	i 've a picture like it in one of my books crowds of lovely people and children with garlands and branches with blossoms on them everyone laughing and dancing and crowding and playing on pipes 
113.txt	that morning when you ran in and said it 's come ! that was why i said perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets
113.txt	and told you to throw open the window 
113.txt	how funny !
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	and if all the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild creatures danced past at once what a crowd it would be !
113.txt	i 'm sure they 'd dance and sing and flute and that would be the wafts of music 
113.txt	that 's really just what it feels like
113.txt	a little later the nurse made colin ready 
113.txt	she noticed that instead of lying like a log while his clothes were put on he sat up and made some efforts to help himself and he talked and laughed with mary all the time
113.txt	this is one of his good days sir
113.txt	she said to dr craven who dropped in to inspect him 
113.txt	he 's in such good spirits that it makes him stronger 
113.txt	i 'll call in again later in the afternoon after he has come in
113.txt	craven 
113.txt	said dr 
113.txt	i must see how the going out agrees with him  i wish
113.txt	in a very low voice
113.txt	that he would let you go with him 
113.txt	i 'd rather give up the case this moment sir than even stay here while it 's suggested
113.txt	with sudden firmness
113.txt	i had n't really decided to suggest it
113.txt	said the doctor with his slight nervousness 
113.txt	dickon 's a lad i 'd trust with a new born child 
113.txt	we 'll try the experiment 
113.txt	after the manservant had arranged his rugs and cushions the rajah waved his hand to him and to the nurse
113.txt	you have my permission to go
113.txt	dickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily 
113.txt	mistress mary walked beside it and colin leaned back and lifted his face to the sky 
113.txt	the arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed like white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness 
113.txt	the wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was strange with a wild clear scented sweetness 
113.txt	colin kept lifting his thin chest to draw it in and his big eyes looked as if it were they which were listening listening instead of his ears
113.txt	there are so many sounds of singing and humming and calling out
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	what is that scent the puffs of wind bring ?
113.txt	it 's gorse on th
113.txt	moor that 's openin
113.txt	out
113.txt	answered dickon 
113.txt	eh ! th
113.txt	bees are at it wonderful today
113.txt	in fact every gardener or gardener 's lad had been witched away 
113.txt	but they wound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the fountain beds following their carefully planned route for the mere mysterious pleasure of it 
113.txt	but when at last they turned into the long walk by the ivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made them for some curious reason they could not have explained begin to speak in whispers
113.txt	this is it
113.txt	breathed mary 
113.txt	this is where i used to walk up and down and wonder and wonder 
113.txt	is it ?
113.txt	cried colin and his eyes began to search the ivy with eager curiousness 
113.txt	but i can see nothing
113.txt	he whispered 
113.txt	there is no door 
113.txt	that 's what i thought
113.txt	then there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair wheeled on
113.txt	that is the garden where ben weatherstaff works
113.txt	is it ?
113.txt	said colin
113.txt	a few yards more and mary whispered again
113.txt	this is where the robin flew over the wall
113.txt	is it ?
113.txt	cried colin 
113.txt	i wish he 'd come again !
113.txt	oh !
113.txt	and that
113.txt	said mary with solemn delight pointing under a big lilac bush
113.txt	is where he perched on the little heap of earth and showed me the key
113.txt	where ?
113.txt	where ? there ?
113.txt	he cried and his eyes were as big as the wolf 's in red riding hood when red riding hood felt called upon to remark on them 
113.txt	dickon stood still and the wheeled chair stopped
113.txt	and this
113.txt	said mary stepping on to the bed close to the ivy
113.txt	is where i went to talk to him when he chirped at me from the top of the wall  and this is the ivy the wind blew back
113.txt	oh ! is it is it !
113.txt	gasped colin
113.txt	dickon push him in push him in quickly !
113.txt	and here is the handle and here is the door
113.txt	but colin had actually dropped back against his cushions even though he gasped with delight and he had covered his eyes with his hands and held them there shutting out everything until they were inside and the chair stopped as if by magic and the door was closed 
113.txt	not till then did he take them away and look round and round and round as dickon and mary had done 
113.txt	and over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept and in the grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here and there everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white and the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and scents 
113.txt	and the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovely touch 
113.txt	and in wonder mary and dickon stood and stared at him 
113.txt	he looked so strange and different because a pink glow of color had actually crept all over him ivory face and neck and hands and all
113.txt	i shall get well ! i shall get well !
113.txt	he cried out 
113.txt	dickon !
113.txt	i shall get well !
113.txt	and i shall live forever and ever and ever !
113.txt	mary !
113.txt	one knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn time and goes out and stands alone and throws one 's head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the east almost makes one cry out and one 's heart stands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sun which has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years 
113.txt	one knows it then for a moment or so 
113.txt	and one knows it sometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something one can not quite hear however much one tries 
113.txt	then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure
113.txt	and sometimes a sound of far off music makes it true
113.txt	and sometimes a look in someone 's eyes
113.txt	and it was like that with colin when he first saw and heard and felt the springtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden 
113.txt	that afternoon the whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantly beautiful and kind to one boy 
113.txt	perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness the spring came and crowned everything it possibly could into that one place 
113.txt	more than once dickon paused in what he was doing and stood still with a sort of growing wonder in his eyes shaking his head softly
113.txt	eh ! it is graidely
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i 'm twelve goin
113.txt	on thirteen an
113.txt	there 's a lot o
113.txt	afternoons in thirteen years but seems to me like i never seed one as graidely as this ere 
113.txt	aye it is a graidely one
113.txt	i 'll warrant it 's the graidelest one as ever was in this world 
113.txt	does tha
113.txt	think
113.txt	said colin with dreamy carefulness
113.txt	as happen it was made loike this ere all o
113.txt	purpose for me ?
113.txt	my word !
113.txt	cried mary admiringly
113.txt	that there is a bit o
113.txt	good yorkshire  thart shapin
113.txt	first rate that tha
113.txt	art
113.txt	they drew the chair under the plum tree which was snow white with blossoms and musical with bees 
113.txt	it was like a king 's canopy a fairy king 's 
113.txt	there were flowering cherry trees near and apple trees whose buds were pink and white and here and there one had burst open wide
113.txt	between the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked down like wonderful eyes
113.txt	mary and dickon worked a little here and there and colin watched them
113.txt	they brought him things to look at buds which were opening buds which were tight closed bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green the feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass the empty shell of some bird early hatched 
113.txt	dickon pushed the chair slowly round and round the garden stopping every other moment to let him look at wonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees 
113.txt	it was like being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queen and shown all the mysterious riches it contained
113.txt	i wonder if we shall see the robin ?
113.txt	said colin
113.txt	tha 'll see him often enow after a bit
113.txt	answered dickon 
113.txt	when th
113.txt	eggs hatches out th
113.txt	little chap he 'll be kep
113.txt	so busy it 'll make his head swim  tha 'll see him flyin
113.txt	backward an
113.txt	forard carryin
113.txt	worms nigh as big as himsel
113.txt	an
113.txt	that much noise goin
113.txt	on in th
113.txt	nest when he gets there as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth to drop th
113.txt	first piece in  an
113.txt	gapin
113.txt	beaks an
113.txt	mother says as when she sees th
113.txt	work a robin has to keep them gapin
113.txt	beaks filled she feels like she was a lady with nothin
113.txt	to do  she says she 's seen th
113.txt	little chaps when it seemed like th
113.txt	sweat must be droppin
113.txt	off em though folk ca n't see it
113.txt	colin had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voices several days before 
113.txt	he liked the mysteriousness of it and did his best but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult never to laugh above a whisper
113.txt	every moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour the sunshine grew more golden 
113.txt	the wheeled chair had been drawn back under the canopy and dickon had sat down on the grass and had just drawn out his pipe when colin saw something he had not had time to notice before
113.txt	that 's a very old tree over there is n't it ?
113.txt	he said
113.txt	dickon looked across the grass at the tree and mary looked and there was a brief moment of stillness
113.txt	yes
113.txt	mary gazed at the tree and thought
113.txt	the branches are quite gray and there 's not a single leaf anywhere
113.txt	colin went on 
113.txt	it 's quite dead is n't it ?
113.txt	aye
113.txt	admitted dickon 
113.txt	but them roses as has climbed all over it will near hide every bit o
113.txt	th
113.txt	dead wood when they 're full o
113.txt	leaves an
113.txt	it wo n't look dead then 
113.txt	flowers  it 'll be th
113.txt	prettiest of all
113.txt	it looks as if a big branch had been broken off
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	i wonder how it was done 
113.txt	it 's been done many a year
113.txt	answered dickon 
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	with a sudden relieved start and laying his hand on colin 
113.txt	there he is !
113.txt	look at that robin ! he 's been foragin
113.txt	for his mate 
113.txt	he darted through the greenness and into the close grown corner and was out of sight 
113.txt	colin leaned back on his cushion again laughing a little
113.txt	perhaps it 's five oclock 
113.txt	i think i 'd like some tea myself 
113.txt	he 's taking her tea to her
113.txt	it was magic which sent the robin
113.txt	said mary secretly to dickon afterward 
113.txt	i know it was magic
113.txt	for both she and dickon had been afraid colin might ask something about the tree whose branch had broken off ten years ago and they had talked it over together and dickon had stood and rubbed his head in a troubled way
113.txt	we mun look as if it was n't no different from th
113.txt	other trees
113.txt	he had said 
113.txt	if he says anything about it we mun we mun try to look cheerful 
113.txt	we could n't never tell him how it broke poor lad 
113.txt	aye that we mun
113.txt	but she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at the tree 
113.txt	she wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any reality in that other thing dickon had said 
113.txt	he had gone on rubbing his rust red hair in a puzzled way but a nice comforted look had begun to grow in his blue eyes
113.txt	mrs craven was a very lovely young lady
113.txt	he had gone on rather hesitatingly 
113.txt	an
113.txt	mother she thinks maybe she 's about misselthwaite many a time lookin
113.txt	after mester colin same as all mothers do when they 're took out o
113.txt	th
113.txt	world  they have to come back tha
113.txt	happen she 's been in the garden an
113.txt	happen it was her set us to work an
113.txt	told us to bring him here 
113.txt	she was a great believer in magic 
113.txt	secretly she quite believed that dickon worked magic of course good magic on everything near him and that was why people liked him so much and wild creatures knew he was their friend
113.txt	she wondered indeed if it were not possible that his gift had brought the robin just at the right moment when colin asked that dangerous question 
113.txt	she felt that his magic was working all the afternoon and making colin look like an entirely different boy 
113.txt	it did not seem possible that he could be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten and bitten his pillow 
113.txt	even his ivory whiteness seemed to change 
113.txt	the faint glow of color which had shown on his face and neck and hands when he first got inside the garden really never quite died away 
113.txt	he looked as if he were made of flesh instead of ivory or wax
113.txt	they saw the robin carry food to his mate two or three times and it was so suggestive of afternoon tea that colin felt they must have some
113.txt	go and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to the rhododendron walk
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	and then you and dickon can bring it here 
113.txt	nut and shell whisked up trees with pieces of cake and soot took the entire half of a buttered crumpet into a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and made hoarse remarks about it until he decided to swallow it all joyfully in one gulp
113.txt	the afternoon was dragging towards its mellow hour 
113.txt	the sun was deepening the gold of its lances the bees were going home and the birds were flying past less often 
113.txt	dickon and mary were sitting on the grass the tea basket was repacked ready to be taken back to the house and colin was lying against his cushions with his heavy locks pushed back from his forehead and his face looking quite a natural color
113.txt	i do n't want this afternoon to go
113.txt	he said
113.txt	but i shall come back tomorrow and the day after and the day after and the day after 
113.txt	you 'll get plenty of fresh air wo n't you ?
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	i 'm going to get nothing else
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	i 'm going to see everything grow here
113.txt	i 'm going to grow here myself 
113.txt	that tha
113.txt	will
113.txt	said dickon 
113.txt	us 'll have thee walkin
113.txt	about here an
113.txt	diggin
113.txt	same as other folk afore long
113.txt	walk !
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	shall i ?
113.txt	dig !
113.txt	neither he nor mary had ever asked if anything was the matter with his legs
113.txt	for sure tha
113.txt	will
113.txt	he said stoutly 
113.txt	tha tha 's got legs o
113.txt	thine own same as other folks !
113.txt	nothing really ails them
113.txt	he said
113.txt	they shake so that i 'm afraid to try to stand on them
113.txt	when tha
113.txt	stops bein
113.txt	afraid thalt stand on em
113.txt	dickon said with renewed cheer 
113.txt	an
113.txt	thalt stop bein
113.txt	afraid in a bit 
113.txt	i shall ?
113.txt	said colin and he lay still as if he were wondering about things
113.txt	they were really very quiet for a little while 
113.txt	the sun was dropping lower 
113.txt	it was that hour when everything stills itself and they really had had a busy and exciting afternoon 
113.txt	colin looked as if he were resting luxuriously 
113.txt	even the creatures had ceased moving about and had drawn together and were resting near them 
113.txt	soot had perched on a low branch and drawn up one leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over his eyes 
113.txt	mary privately thought he looked as if he might snore in a minute
113.txt	in the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when colin half lifted his head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper
113.txt	who is that man ?
113.txt	man !
113.txt	they both cried in low quick voices
113.txt	colin pointed to the high wall
113.txt	look !
113.txt	he whispered excitedly 
113.txt	just look !
113.txt	there was ben weatherstaff 's indignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder !
113.txt	he actually shook his fist at mary
113.txt	if i was n't a bachelder an
113.txt	tha
113.txt	was a wench o
113.txt	mine
113.txt	he cried
113.txt	i 'd give thee a hidin
113.txt	!
113.txt	i never thowt much o
113.txt	thee !
113.txt	he harangued

113.txt	me  if it hadna
113.txt	been for th
113.txt	robin drat him
113.txt	ben weatherstaff
113.txt	she stood below him and called up to him with a sort of gasp 
113.txt	called out mary finding her breath 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff it was the robin who showed me the way !
113.txt	tha
113.txt	young bad un !
113.txt	he called down at her 
113.txt	layin
113.txt	tha
113.txt	badness on a robin not but what he 's impidint enow for anythin
113.txt	 him showin

113.txt	him !
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	way ! tha
113.txt	young nowt
113.txt	she could see his next words burst out because he was overpowered by curiosity
113.txt	however i
113.txt	this world did tha
113.txt	get in ?
113.txt	it was the robin who showed me the way
113.txt	and i ca n't tell you from here while you 're shaking your fist at me 
113.txt	he did n't know he was doing it but he did
113.txt	at the first sound of his torrent of words colin had been so surprised that he had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound 
113.txt	but in the midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to dickon
113.txt	wheel me over there !
113.txt	he commanded 
113.txt	wheel me quite close and stop right in front of him !
113.txt	a wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes which came toward him looking rather like some sort of state coach because a young rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his great black rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him
113.txt	and it stopped right under ben weatherstaff 's nose 
113.txt	it was really no wonder his mouth dropped open
113.txt	do you know who i am ?
113.txt	demanded the rajah
113.txt	how ben weatherstaff stared !
113.txt	his red old eyes fixed themselves on what was before him as if he were seeing a ghost 
113.txt	he gazed and gazed and gulped a lump down his throat and did not say a word
113.txt	do you know who i am ?
113.txt	demanded colin still more imperiously
113.txt	answer !
113.txt	who tha
113.txt	art ?
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	aye that i do wi
113.txt	tha
113.txt	mother 's eyes starin
113.txt	at me out o
113.txt	tha
113.txt	face  lord knows how tha
113.txt	come here  but thart th
113.txt	poor cripple 
113.txt	his face flushed scarlet and he sat bolt upright
113.txt	i 'm not a cripple !
113.txt	he cried out furiously 
113.txt	i 'm not !
113.txt	he 's not !
113.txt	cried mary almost shouting up the wall in her fierce indignation 
113.txt	i looked and there was none there not one !
113.txt	he 's not got a lump as big as a pin !
113.txt	his hand shook and his mouth shook and his voice shook 
113.txt	he was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and he could only remember the things he had heard
113.txt	thatha
113.txt	has n't got a crooked back ?
113.txt	he said hoarsely
113.txt	no !
113.txt	shouted colin
113.txt	thatha
113.txt	has n't got crooked legs ?
113.txt	quavered ben more hoarsely yet
113.txt	it was too much 
113.txt	the strength which colin usually threw into his tantrums rushed through him now in a new way 
113.txt	never yet had he been accused of crooked legs even in whispers and the perfectly simple belief in their existence which was revealed by ben weatherstaff 's voice was more than rajah flesh and blood could endure 
113.txt	his anger and insulted pride made him forget everything but this one moment and filled him with a power he had never known before an almost unnatural strength
113.txt	come here !
113.txt	he shouted to dickon and he actually began to tear the coverings off his lower limbs and disentangle himself 
113.txt	come here !
113.txt	this minute !
113.txt	come here !
113.txt	mary caught her breath in a short gasp and felt herself turn pale
113.txt	he can do it !
113.txt	he can do it !
113.txt	he can do it ! he can !
113.txt	she gabbled over to herself under her breath as fast as ever she could
113.txt	there was a brief fierce scramble the rugs were tossed on the ground dickon held colin 's arm the thin legs were out the thin feet were on the grass 
113.txt	colin was standing upright upright as straight as an arrow and looking strangely tall his head thrown back and his strange eyes flashing lightning
113.txt	look at me !
113.txt	he flung up at ben weatherstaff
113.txt	just look at me !
113.txt	he 's as straight as i am !
113.txt	cried dickon 
113.txt	he 's as straight as any lad i
113.txt	yorkshire !
113.txt	he choked and gulped and suddenly tears ran down his weather wrinkled cheeks as he struck his old hands together
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	he burst forth
113.txt	th
113.txt	lies folk tells ! thart as thin as a lath an
113.txt	thalt make a mon yet 
113.txt	god bless thee !
113.txt	as white as a wraith but there 's not a knob on thee
113.txt	he stood straighter and straighter and looked ben weatherstaff in the face
113.txt	i 'm your master
113.txt	he said
113.txt	and you are to obey me 
113.txt	this is my garden 
113.txt	do n't dare to say a word about it !
113.txt	you get down from that ladder and go out to the long walk and miss mary will meet you and bring you here 
113.txt	i want to talk to you 
113.txt	we did not want you but now you will have to be in the secret 
113.txt	be quick !
113.txt	when my father is away 
113.txt	it seemed as if he could not take his eyes from thin straight colin standing on his feet with his head thrown back
113.txt	eh ! lad
113.txt	he almost whispered 
113.txt	eh ! my lad !
113.txt	and then remembering himself he suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion and said
113.txt	yes sir ! yes sir !
113.txt	and obediently disappeared as he descended the ladder
113.txt	chapter xxii when the sun went down when his head was out of sight colin turned to mary
113.txt	go and meet him
113.txt	dickon was watching him with sharp eyes 
113.txt	there were scarlet spots on his cheeks and he looked amazing but he showed no signs of falling
113.txt	i can stand
113.txt	i told thee tha
113.txt	could as soon as tha
113.txt	stopped bein
113.txt	afraid
113.txt	answered dickon 
113.txt	an
113.txt	tha 's stopped 
113.txt	yes i 've stopped
113.txt	then suddenly he remembered something mary had said
113.txt	are you making magic ?
113.txt	he asked sharply
113.txt	dickon 's curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin
113.txt	tha 's doin
113.txt	magic thysel
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	it 's same magic as made these ere work out o
113.txt	th
113.txt	earth
113.txt	colin looked down at them
113.txt	aye
113.txt	he said slowly
113.txt	there couldna
113.txt	be bigger magic than that there there couldna
113.txt	be
113.txt	i 'm going to walk to that tree
113.txt	he said pointing to one a few feet away from him
113.txt	i can rest against the tree if i like 
113.txt	when i want to sit down i will sit down but not before 
113.txt	bring a rug from the chair 
113.txt	when he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that he supported himself against it and he still held himself so straight that he looked tall
113.txt	when ben weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw him standing there and he heard mary muttering something under her breath
113.txt	what art sayin
113.txt	?
113.txt	he asked rather testily because he did not want his attention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud face
113.txt	but she did not tell him 
113.txt	what she was saying was this
113.txt	you can do it !
113.txt	i told you you could !
113.txt	you can do it !
113.txt	you can do it !
113.txt	you can do it ! you can !
113.txt	she could not bear that he should give in before ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	he did not give in 
113.txt	she was uplifted by a sudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful in spite of his thinness 
113.txt	he fixed his eyes on ben weatherstaff in his funny imperious way
113.txt	look at me !
113.txt	he commanded 
113.txt	am i a hunchback ?
113.txt	have i got crooked legs ?
113.txt	not tha
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	nowt o

113.txt	who thought that ?

113.txt	give me thy orders 
113.txt	mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she could as they had come down the long walk 
113.txt	the chief thing to be remembered she had told him was that colin was getting well getting well 
113.txt	the garden was doing it 
113.txt	no one must let him remember about having humps and dying
113.txt	the rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree
113.txt	what work do you do in the gardens weatherstaff ?
113.txt	he inquired
113.txt	anythin
113.txt	i 'm told to do

113.txt	this was her garden was n't it ?
113.txt	aye it was that !
113.txt	and ben weatherstaff looked about him too 
113.txt	she were main fond of it

113.txt	when ?

113.txt	rubbing his chin and looking round
113.txt	was about two year

113.txt	cried colin
113.txt	there was no door !

113.txt	an
113.txt	it 'll be easier for a man wi
113.txt	rheumatics to come in at th
113.txt	door 
113.txt	colin stretched out his hand and took it up 
113.txt	an odd expression came into his face and he began to scratch at the earth 
113.txt	his thin hand was weak enough but presently as they watched him mary with quite breathless interest he drove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over
113.txt	you can do it ! you can do it !
113.txt	said mary to herself 
113.txt	i tell you you can !
113.txt	ben weatherstaff looked on with interested face
113.txt	colin persevered 
113.txt	after he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spoke exultantly to dickon in his best yorkshire
113.txt	tha
113.txt	said as tha 'd have me walkin

113.txt	quick !
113.txt	ben weatherstaff went his way forgetting rheumatics 
113.txt	dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper and wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it 
113.txt	mary slipped out to run and bring back a watering can 
113.txt	when dickon had deepened the hole colin went on turning the soft earth over and over
113.txt	he looked up at the sky flushed and glowing with the strangely new exercise slight as it was
113.txt	i want to do it before the sun goes quite quite down
113.txt	mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on purpose 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the greenhouse 
113.txt	he hobbled over the grass as fast as he could 
113.txt	he had begun to be excited too 
113.txt	he knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from the mould
113.txt	here lad
113.txt	he said handing the plant to colin 
113.txt	set it in the earth thysel
113.txt	same as th
113.txt	king does when he goes to a new place 
113.txt	it was filled in and pressed down and made steady 
113.txt	mary was leaning forward on her hands and knees 
113.txt	soot had flown down and marched forward to see what was being done 
113.txt	nut and shell chattered about it from a cherry tree
113.txt	it 's planted !
113.txt	said colin at last 
113.txt	help me up dickon 
113.txt	i want to be standing when it goes
113.txt	that 's part of the magic
113.txt	chapter xxiii magic dr 
113.txt	craven had been waiting some time at the house when they returned to it 
113.txt	he had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send someone out to explore the garden paths 
113.txt	when colin was brought back to his room the poor man looked him over seriously
113.txt	you should not have stayed so long
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	you must not overexert yourself 
113.txt	i am not tired at all
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	tomorrow i am going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon 
113.txt	it has made me well 
113.txt	i am not sure that i can allow it
113.txt	answered dr craven 
113.txt	i am afraid it would not be wise 
113.txt	it would not be wise to try to stop me
113.txt	i am going 
113.txt	he had lived on a sort of desert island all his life and as he had been the king of it he had made his own manners and had had no one to compare himself with 
113.txt	mary had indeed been rather like him herself and since she had been at misselthwaite had gradually discovered that her own manners had not been of the kind which is usual or popular 
113.txt	having made this discovery she naturally thought it of enough interest to communicate to colin 
113.txt	so she sat and looked at him curiously for a few minutes after dr craven had gone
113.txt	she wanted to make him ask her why she was doing it and of course she did
113.txt	what are you looking at me for ?
113.txt	he said
113.txt	craven 
113.txt	i 'm thinking that i am rather sorry for dr 
113.txt	so am i
113.txt	said colin calmly but not without an air of some satisfaction 
113.txt	he wo n't get misselthwaite at all now i 'm not going to die 
113.txt	i 'm sorry for him because of that of course
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	i would never have done it 
113.txt	but i was thinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be polite for ten years to a boy who was always rude 
113.txt	am i rude ?
113.txt	colin inquired undisturbedly
113.txt	if you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	he would have slapped you 
113.txt	but he dare n't
113.txt	no he dare n't
113.txt	answered mistress mary thinking the thing out quite without prejudice 
113.txt	you were such a poor thing 
113.txt	nobody ever dared to do anything you did n't like because you were going to die and things like that 
113.txt	but
113.txt	announced colin stubbornly
113.txt	i wo n't let people think i 'm one 
113.txt	i stood on my feet this afternoon 
113.txt	it is always having your own way that has made you so queer
113.txt	colin turned his head frowning
113.txt	am i queer ?
113.txt	he demanded
113.txt	yes
113.txt	answered mary
113.txt	very  but you need n't be cross
113.txt	she added impartially
113.txt	but i am not as queer as i was before i began to like people and before i found the garden 
113.txt	because so am i queer and so is ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	i do n't want to be queer
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	i am not going to be
113.txt	he was a very proud boy 
113.txt	he lay thinking for a while and then mary saw his beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face
113.txt	i shall stop being queer
113.txt	he said
113.txt	there is magic in there good magic you know mary 
113.txt	i am sure there is 
113.txt	so am i
113.txt	even if it is n't real magic
113.txt	colin said
113.txt	something is there something !
113.txt	it 's magic
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	it 's as white as snow 
113.txt	but not black
113.txt	oh !
113.txt	the things which happened in that garden !
113.txt	if you have never had a garden you can not understand and if you have had a garden you will know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass there 
113.txt	at first it seemed that green things would never cease pushing their way through the earth in the grass in the beds even in the crevices of the walls 
113.txt	then the green things began to show buds and the buds began to unfurl and show color every shade of blue every shade of purple every tint and hue of crimson 
113.txt	in its happy days flowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from between the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging things to grow on 
113.txt	iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas
113.txt	she was main fond o
113.txt	them she was
113.txt	ben weatherstaff said 
113.txt	she liked them things as was allus pointin
113.txt	up to th
113.txt	not as she was one o
113.txt	them as looked down on th
113.txt	earth not her  she just loved it but she said as th
113.txt	blue sky allus looked so joyful 
113.txt	satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score gaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and which it might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people had got there 
113.txt	and the roses the roses !
113.txt	rising out of the grass tangled round the sun dial wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their branches climbing up the walls and spreading over them with long garlands falling in cascades they came alive day by day hour by hour
113.txt	fair fresh leaves and buds and buds tiny at first but swelling and working magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent delicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the garden air
113.txt	colin saw it all watching each change as it took place 
113.txt	every morning he was brought out and every hour of each day when it did n't rain he spent in the garden 
113.txt	even gray days pleased him 
113.txt	he would lie on the grass
113.txt	watching things growing
113.txt	if you watched long enough he declared you could see buds unsheath themselves 
113.txt	also you could make the acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on various unknown but evidently serious errands sometimes carrying tiny scraps of straw or feather or food or climbing blades of grass as if they were trees from whose tops one could look out to explore the country 
113.txt	a mole throwing up its mound at the end of its burrow and making its way out at last with the long nailed paws which looked so like elfish hands had absorbed him one whole morning 
113.txt	he said  ants
113.txt	ways beetles
113.txt	ways bees
113.txt	ways frogs
113.txt	ways birds
113.txt	ways plants
113.txt	ways gave him a new world to explore and when dickon revealed them all and added foxes
113.txt	ways otters
113.txt	ways ferrets
113.txt	ways squirrels
113.txt	ways and trout
113.txt	and water rats
113.txt	and badgers
113.txt	and this was not the half of the magic 
113.txt	the fact that he had really once stood on his feet had set colin thinking tremendously and when mary told him of the spell she had worked he was excited and approved of it greatly 
113.txt	he talked of it constantly
113.txt	of course there must be lots of magic in the world
113.txt	he said wisely one day
113.txt	perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen 
113.txt	i am going to try and experiment 
113.txt	ben came as quickly as he could and found the rajah standing on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also very beautifully smiling
113.txt	good morning ben weatherstaff
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i want you and dickon and miss mary to stand in a row and listen to me because i am going to tell you something very important 
113.txt	aye aye sir !
113.txt	answered ben weatherstaff touching his forehead 
113.txt	one of the long concealed charms of ben weatherstaff was that in his boyhood he had once run away to sea and had made voyages 
113.txt	so he could reply like a sailor 
113.txt	i am going to try a scientific experiment
113.txt	explained the rajah 
113.txt	when i grow up i am going to make great scientific discoveries and i am going to begin now with this experiment 
113.txt	aye aye sir !
113.txt	said ben weatherstaff promptly though this was the first time he had heard of great scientific discoveries
113.txt	it was the first time mary had heard of them either but even at this stage she had begun to realize that queer as he was colin had read about a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincing sort of boy 
113.txt	when he held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on you it seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though he was only ten years old going on eleven 
113.txt	at this moment he was especially convincing because he suddenly felt the fascination of actually making a sort of speech like a grown up person
113.txt	the great scientific discoveries i am going to make
113.txt	he went on
113.txt	magic is a great thing and scarcely anyone knows anything about it except a few people in old books and mary a little because she was born in india where there are fakirs 
113.txt	i believe dickon knows some magic but perhaps he does n't know he knows it 
113.txt	he charms animals and people 
113.txt	i would never have let him come to see me if he had not been an animal charmer which is a boy charmer too because a boy is an animal 
113.txt	i am sure there is magic in everything only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us like electricity and horses and steam 
113.txt	will be about magic
113.txt	aye aye sir
113.txt	when mary found this garden it looked quite dead
113.txt	the orator proceeded 
113.txt	one day things were n't there and another they were 
113.txt	i had never watched things before and it made me feel very curious 
113.txt	scientific people are always curious and i am going to be scientific 
113.txt	i keep saying to myself what is it ?
113.txt	what is it ?
113.txt	
113.txt	it 's something 
113.txt	it ca n't be nothing !
113.txt	i do n't know its name so i call it magic 
113.txt	i have never seen the sun rise but mary and dickon have and from what they tell me i am sure that is magic too 
113.txt	something pushes it up and draws it 
113.txt	sometimes since i 've been in the garden i 've looked up through the trees at the sky and i have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast 
113.txt	magic is always pushing and drawing and making things out of nothing 
113.txt	everything is made out of magic leaves and trees flowers and birds badgers and foxes and squirrels and people 
113.txt	so it must be all around us 
113.txt	in this garden in all the places 
113.txt	the magic in this garden has made me stand up and know i am going to live to be a man 
113.txt	i am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong 
113.txt	i do n't know how to do it but i think that if you keep thinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come 
113.txt	perhaps that is the first baby way to get it 
113.txt	when i was going to try to stand that first time mary kept saying to herself as fast as she could you can do it !
113.txt	you can do it !
113.txt	and i did 
113.txt	i had to try myself at the same time of course but her magic helped me and so did dickon 's 
113.txt	every morning and evening and as often in the daytime as i can remember i am going to say magic is in me !
113.txt	magic is making me well !
113.txt	i am going to be as strong as dickon as strong as dickon !
113.txt	
113.txt	and you must all do it too 
113.txt	that is my experiment will you help ben weatherstaff ?
113.txt	then something began pushing things up out of the soil and making things out of nothing 
113.txt	aye aye sir !
113.txt	said ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	aye aye !
113.txt	you learn things by saying them over and over and thinking about them until they stay in your mind forever and i think it will be the same with magic 
113.txt	if you keep calling it to come to you and help you it will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things 
113.txt	if you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go through drill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment succeeds 
113.txt	i once heard an officer in india tell my mother that there were fakirs who said words over and over thousands of times
113.txt	i 've heard jem fettleworth 's wife say th
113.txt	same thing over thousands o
113.txt	times callin
113.txt	jem a drunken brute
113.txt	summat allus come o
113.txt	that sure enough  he gave her a good hidin
113.txt	an
113.txt	went to th
113.txt	blue lion an
113.txt	got as drunk as a lord 
113.txt	then he cheered up
113.txt	well
113.txt	he said
113.txt	she used the wrong magic until she made him beat her 
113.txt	if she 'd used the right magic and had said something nice perhaps he would n't have got as drunk as a lord and perhaps perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet 
113.txt	you see something did come of it
113.txt	thart a clever lad as well as a straight legged one mester colin
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	next time i see bess fettleworth i 'll give her a bit of a hint o
113.txt	what magic will do for her  she 'd be rare an
113.txt	pleased if th
113.txt	sinetifik speriment worked an
113.txt	so ud jem 
113.txt	nut and shell were on his shoulders and he held a long eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softly while it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself
113.txt	do you think the experiment will work ?
113.txt	colin asked him wondering what he was thinking 
113.txt	he so often wondered what dickon was thinking when he saw him looking at him or at one of his
113.txt	creatures
113.txt	he smiled now and his smile was wider than usual
113.txt	aye
113.txt	he answered
113.txt	that i do  it 'll work same as th
113.txt	seeds do when th
113.txt	it 'll work for sure 
113.txt	shall us begin it now ?
113.txt	sun shines on em 
113.txt	fired by recollections of fakirs and devotees in illustrations colin suggested that they should all sit cross legged under the tree which made a canopy
113.txt	it will be like sitting in a sort of temple
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	i 'm rather tired and i want to sit down
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	said dickon
113.txt	tha
113.txt	must n't begin by sayin
113.txt	thart tired  tha
113.txt	might spoil th
113.txt	magic
113.txt	that 's true
113.txt	he said slowly 
113.txt	i must only think of the magic 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff felt as if he had somehow been led into appearing at a prayer meeting 
113.txt	it all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in their circle  ordinarily he was very fixed in being what he called
113.txt	agen
113.txt	prayer meetin 's
113.txt	mistress mary felt solemnly enraptured
113.txt	dickon held his rabbit in his arm and perhaps he made some charmer 's signal no one heard for when he sat down cross legged like the rest the crow the fox the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made part of the circle settling each into a place of rest as if of their own desire
113.txt	the creatures
113.txt	have come
113.txt	said colin gravely 
113.txt	they want to help us 
113.txt	he held his head high as if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange eyes had a wonderful look in them 
113.txt	the light shone on him through the tree canopy
113.txt	now we will begin
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	shall we sway backward and forward mary as if we were dervishes ?
113.txt	i canna
113.txt	do no swayin
113.txt	backard and forard
113.txt	i 've got th
113.txt	rheumatics 
113.txt	the magic will take them away
113.txt	said colin in a high priest tone
113.txt	we will only chant 
113.txt	but we wo n't sway until it has done it 
113.txt	i canna
113.txt	do no chantin
113.txt	said ben weatherstaff a trifle testily 
113.txt	they turned me out o
113.txt	th
113.txt	church choir th
113.txt	only time i ever tried it 
113.txt	they were all too much in earnest 
113.txt	colin 's face was not even crossed by a shadow 
113.txt	he was thinking only of the magic
113.txt	then i will chant
113.txt	and he began looking like a strange boy spirit 
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	that is the magic 
113.txt	the flowers are growing the roots are stirring 
113.txt	that is the magic 
113.txt	being alive is the magic being strong is the magic 
113.txt	the magic is in me the magic is in me 
113.txt	it is in me it is in me 
113.txt	it 's in everyone of us 
113.txt	it 's in ben weatherstaff 's back 
113.txt	magic !
113.txt	magic !
113.txt	come and help !
113.txt	the sun is shining the sun is shining 
113.txt	mary listened entranced 
113.txt	she felt as if it were at once queer and beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff began to feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable
113.txt	the humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice and drowsily melted into a doze 
113.txt	dickon sat cross legged with his rabbit asleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb 's back 
113.txt	soot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder the gray film dropped over his eyes 
113.txt	at last colin stopped
113.txt	now i am going to walk round the garden
113.txt	ben weatherstaff 's head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with a jerk
113.txt	you have been asleep
113.txt	nowt o
113.txt	th
113.txt	sort
113.txt	mumbled ben 
113.txt	th
113.txt	sermon was good enow but i 'm bound to get out afore th
113.txt	collection
113.txt	you 're not in church
113.txt	not me
113.txt	said ben straightening himself 
113.txt	i heard every bit of it 
113.txt	who said i were ? you said th
113.txt	magic was in my back  th
113.txt	doctor calls it rheumatics
113.txt	that was the wrong magic
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	you have my permission to go to your work 
113.txt	but come back tomorrow 
113.txt	you will get better 
113.txt	i 'd like to see thee walk round the garden
113.txt	it was not an unfriendly grunt but it was a grunt 
113.txt	in fact being a stubborn old party and not having entire faith in magic he had made up his mind that if he were sent away he would climb his ladder and look over the wall so that he might be ready to hobble back if there were any stumbling
113.txt	the rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession was formed 
113.txt	it really did look like a procession 
113.txt	colin was at its head with dickon on one side and mary on the other 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff walked behind and the
113.txt	creatures
113.txt	it was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity 
113.txt	every few yards it stopped to rest 
113.txt	colin leaned on dickon 's arm and privately ben weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout but now and then colin took his hand from its support and walked a few steps alone 
113.txt	his head was held up all the time and he looked very grand
113.txt	the magic is in me !
113.txt	he kept saying 
113.txt	i can feel it !
113.txt	i can feel it !
113.txt	the magic is making me strong !
113.txt	he sat on the seats in the alcoves and once or twice he sat down on the grass and several times he paused in the path and leaned on dickon but he would not give up until he had gone all round the garden 
113.txt	when he returned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he looked triumphant
113.txt	i did it ! the magic worked !
113.txt	he cried 
113.txt	that is my first scientific discovery 
113.txt	what will dr craven say ?
113.txt	broke out mary
113.txt	he wo n't say anything
113.txt	colin answered
113.txt	this is to be the biggest secret of all 
113.txt	no one is to know anything about it until i have grown so strong that i can walk and run like any other boy 
113.txt	i shall come here every day in my chair and i shall be taken back in it 
113.txt	i wo n't have people whispering and asking questions and i wo n't let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite succeeded 
113.txt	then sometime when he comes back to misselthwaite i shall just walk into his study and say here i am
113.txt	i am like any other boy 
113.txt	i am quite well and i shall live to be a man 
113.txt	it has been done by a scientific experiment 
113.txt	he will think he is in a dream
113.txt	cried mary 
113.txt	he wo n't believe his eyes 
113.txt	he had made himself believe that he was going to get well which was really more than half the battle if he had been aware of it 
113.txt	colin flushed triumphantly  and the thought which stimulated him more than any other was this imagining what his father would look like when he saw that he had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers
113.txt	one of his darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days had been his hatred of being a sickly weak backed boy whose father was afraid to look at him
113.txt	he 'll be obliged to believe them
113.txt	one of the things i am going to do after the magic works and before i begin to make scientific discoveries is to be an athlete 
113.txt	we shall have thee takin
113.txt	to boxin
113.txt	in a week or so
113.txt	said ben weatherstaff 
113.txt	thalt end wi

113.txt	belt an
113.txt	bein
113.txt	champion prize fighter of all england
113.txt	weatherstaff
113.txt	he said
113.txt	you must not take liberties because you are in the secret 
113.txt	however much the magic works i shall not be a prize fighter 
113.txt	i shall be a scientific discoverer 
113.txt	that is disrespectful 
113.txt	ax pardon ax pardon sir
113.txt	answered ben touching his forehead in salute 
113.txt	i ought to have seed it was n't a jokin
113.txt	matter
113.txt	he really did not mind being snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining strength and spirit
113.txt	chapter xxiv
113.txt	let them laugh
113.txt	round the cottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough stones 
113.txt	early in the morning and late in the fading twilight and on all the days colin and mary did not see him dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes and cabbages turnips and carrots and herbs for his mother 
113.txt	the secret garden was not the only one dickon worked in  in the company of his
113.txt	creatures
113.txt	while he dug or weeded he whistled or sang bits of yorkshire moor songs or talked to soot or captain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him
113.txt	we 'd never get on as comfortable as we do
113.txt	mrs sowerby said
113.txt	anything 'll grow for him 
113.txt	if it was n't for dickon 's garden  his taters and cabbages is twice th
113.txt	size of anyone else 's an
113.txt	they 've got a flavor with em as nobody 's has
113.txt	after supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her quiet time 
113.txt	she could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the day 
113.txt	she loved this time 
113.txt	there were not only vegetables in this garden 
113.txt	dickon had bought penny packages of flower seeds now and then and sown bright sweet scented things among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps 
113.txt	the low wall was one of the prettiest things in yorkshire because he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock cress and hedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones were to be seen
113.txt	all a chap 's got to do to make em thrive mother
113.txt	he would say
113.txt	is to be friends with em for sure  they 're just like th
113.txt	creatures
113.txt	if they 're thirsty give em drink and if they 're hungry give em a bit o
113.txt	they want to live same as we do 
113.txt	if they died i should feel as if i 'd been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless 
113.txt	food 
113.txt	it was in these twilight hours that mrs sowerby heard of all that happened at misselthwaite manor  at first she was only told that
113.txt	mester colin
113.txt	had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with miss mary and that it was doing him good  but it was not long before it was agreed between the two children that dickon 's mother might
113.txt	come into the secret
113.txt	somehow it was not doubted that she was
113.txt	safe for sure 
113.txt	the coming of dickon and how it had been told to him the doubt of mester colin and the final drama of his introduction to the hidden domain combined with the incident of ben weatherstaff 's angry face peering over the wall and mester colin 's sudden indignant strength made mrs sowerby 's nice looking face quite change color several times
113.txt	my word !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	it was a good thing that little lass came to th
113.txt	manor  it 's been th
113.txt	makin
113.txt	o
113.txt	her an
113.txt	th
113.txt	savin o
113.txt	him  standin
113.txt	on his feet ! an
113.txt	us all thinkin
113.txt	he was a poor half witted lad with not a straight bone in him
113.txt	what do they make of it at th
113.txt	manor him being so well an
113.txt	cheerful an
113.txt	never complainin
113.txt	?
113.txt	she inquired
113.txt	they do n't know what to make of it
113.txt	answered dickon 
113.txt	every day as comes round his face looks different  it 's fillin
113.txt	out and does n't look so sharp an
113.txt	th
113.txt	waxy color is goin
113.txt	 but he has to do his bit o
113.txt	complainin
113.txt	what for i
113.txt	mercy 's name ?
113.txt	asked mrs sowerby
113.txt	dickon chuckled
113.txt	he does it to keep them from guessin
113.txt	if the doctor knew he 'd found out he could stand on his feet he 'd likely write and tell mester craven 
113.txt	what 's happened  mester colin 's savin
113.txt	th
113.txt	he 's goin
113.txt	to practise his magic on his legs every day till his father comes back an
113.txt	then he 's goin
113.txt	to march into his room an
113.txt	show him he 's as straight as other lads  but him an
113.txt	miss mary thinks it 's best plan to do a bit o
113.txt	groanin
113.txt	an
113.txt	frettin
113.txt	now an
113.txt	then to throw folk off th
113.txt	scent
113.txt	sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he had finished his last sentence
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	she said
113.txt	that pair 's enjoyin
113.txt	theirselves i 'll warrant  they 'll get a good bit o
113.txt	actin
113.txt	out of it an
113.txt	there 's nothin
113.txt	children likes as much as play actin
113.txt	let 's hear what they do dickon lad 
113.txt	
113.txt	his eyes were twinkling with fun
113.txt	mester colin is carried down to his chair every time he goes out
113.txt	he explained 
113.txt	an
113.txt	he flies out at john th
113.txt	footman for not carryin
113.txt	him careful enough  he makes himself as helpless lookin
113.txt	as he can an
113.txt	never lifts his head until we 're out o
113.txt	sight o
113.txt	th
113.txt	house  an
113.txt	he grunts an
113.txt	frets a good bit when he 's bein
113.txt	settled into his chair  him an
113.txt	miss mary 's both got to enjoyin
113.txt	it an
113.txt	when he groans an
113.txt	does it hurt you so much ?
113.txt	are you so weak as that poor colin ?
113.txt	
113.txt	complains she 'll say poor colin ! but th
113.txt	trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin
113.txt	out laughin
113.txt	when we get safe into the garden they laugh till they 've no breath left to laugh with 
113.txt	 an
113.txt	they have to stuff their faces into mester colin 's cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin
113.txt	if any of em 's about 
113.txt	th
113.txt	more they laugh th
113.txt	better for em !
113.txt	said mrs sowerby still laughing herself 
113.txt	good healthy child laughin 's better than pills any day o
113.txt	th
113.txt	that pair 'll plump up for sure 
113.txt	year 
113.txt	they are plumpin
113.txt	up
113.txt	said dickon 
113.txt	they 're that hungry they do n't know how to get enough to eat without makin
113.txt	talk  mester colin says if he keeps sendin
113.txt	for more food they wo n't believe he 's an invalid at all  miss mary says she 'll let him eat her share but he says that if she goes hungry she 'll get thin an
113.txt	they mun both get fat at once
113.txt	sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty that she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak and dickon laughed with her
113.txt	i 'll tell thee what lad
113.txt	i 've thought of a way to help em  when tha
113.txt	goes to em in th
113.txt	mornin 's tha
113.txt	shall take a pail o
113.txt	good new milk an
113.txt	i 'll bake em a crusty cottage loaf or some buns wi
113.txt	currants in em same as you children like  nothin 's so good as fresh milk an
113.txt	bread  then they could take off th
113.txt	edge o
113.txt	their hunger while they were in their garden an
113.txt	th fine food they get indoors ud polish off th
113.txt	corners
113.txt	eh ! mother !
113.txt	said dickon admiringly
113.txt	what a wonder tha
113.txt	art ! tha
113.txt	always sees a way out o
113.txt	they was quite in a pother yesterday
113.txt	they did n't see how they was to manage without orderin
113.txt	up more food they felt that empty inside 
113.txt	they 're two young uns growin
113.txt	fast an
113.txt	health 's comin
113.txt	back to both of em  children like that feels like young wolves an
113.txt	food 's flesh an
113.txt	blood to em
113.txt	then she smiled dickon 's own curving smile 
113.txt	said mrs sowerby 
113.txt	eh ! but they 're enjoyin
113.txt	theirselves for sure
113.txt	she was quite right the comfortable wonderful mother creature and she had never been more so than when she said their
113.txt	play actin
113.txt	colin and mary found it one of their most thrilling sources of entertainment 
113.txt	the idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had been unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and then by dr craven himself
113.txt	your appetite  is improving very much master colin
113.txt	the nurse had said one day 
113.txt	you used to eat nothing and so many things disagreed with you 
113.txt	nothing disagrees with me now
113.txt	replied colin and then seeing the nurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps he ought not to appear too well just yet 
113.txt	it 's the fresh air 
113.txt	at least things do n't so often disagree with me 
113.txt	perhaps it is
113.txt	said the nurse still looking at him with a mystified expression 
113.txt	but i must talk to dr craven about it 
113.txt	how she stared at you !
113.txt	said mary when she went away 
113.txt	as if she thought there must be something to find out 
113.txt	i wo n't have her finding out things
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	no one must begin to find out yet 
113.txt	he asked a number of questions to colin 's great annoyance
113.txt	you stay out in the garden a great deal
113.txt	he suggested 
113.txt	where do you go ?
113.txt	i will not let anyone know where i go
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	everyone has orders to keep out of the way 
113.txt	i wo n't be watched and stared at 
113.txt	you know that !
113.txt	i go to a place i like 
113.txt	the nurse says that you eat much more than you have ever done before 
113.txt	you seem to be out all day but i do not think it has done you harm i do not think so 
113.txt	perhaps
113.txt	said colin prompted by a sudden inspiration
113.txt	perhaps it is an unnatural appetite 
113.txt	i do not think so as your food seems to agree with you
113.txt	craven 
113.txt	you are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better 
113.txt	perhaps perhaps i am bloated and feverish
113.txt	said colin assuming a discouraging air of gloom 
113.txt	people who are not going to live are often different
113.txt	craven shook his head 
113.txt	he was holding colin 's wrist and he pushed up his sleeve and felt his arm
113.txt	you are not feverish
113.txt	he said thoughtfully
113.txt	if you can keep this up my boy we need not talk of dying 
113.txt	your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable improvement 
113.txt	and such flesh as you have gained is healthy 
113.txt	i wo n't have him told !
113.txt	colin broke forth fiercely 
113.txt	i might have a raging fever 
113.txt	i feel as if i might be beginning to have one now 
113.txt	i wo n't have letters written to my father i wo n't i wo n't !
113.txt	you are making me angry and you know that is bad for me 
113.txt	i feel hot already 
113.txt	it will only disappoint him if i get worse again and i may get worse this very night  i hate being written about and being talked over as much as i hate being stared at !
113.txt	hush h ! my boy
113.txt	dr craven soothed him 
113.txt	you are too sensitive about things 
113.txt	you must not undo the good which has been done 
113.txt	nothing shall be written without your permission
113.txt	the boy is extraordinarily better
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	but of course he is doing now of his own free will what we could not make him do before 
113.txt	still he excites himself very easily and nothing must be said to irritate him 
113.txt	his advance seems almost abnormal 
113.txt	mary and colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously  from this time dated their plan of
113.txt	play actin
113.txt	
113.txt	i may be obliged to have a tantrum
113.txt	said colin regretfully 
113.txt	perhaps i could n't have one at all 
113.txt	that lump does n't come in my throat now and i keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible ones 
113.txt	but if they talk about writing to my father i shall have to do something 
113.txt	i do n't want to have one and i 'm not miserable enough now to work myself into a big one 
113.txt	mary always breakfasted with him and when they found themselves at the table particularly if there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover they would look into each other 's eyes in desperation
113.txt	i think we shall have to eat it all this morning mary
113.txt	colin always ended by saying 
113.txt	we can send away some of the lunch and a great deal of the dinner
113.txt	i do wish
113.txt	colin would say also
113.txt	i do wish the slices of ham were thicker and one muffin each is not enough for anyone 
113.txt	it 's enough for a person who is going to die
113.txt	answered mary when first she heard this
113.txt	i sometimes feel as if i could eat three when those nice fresh heather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window 
113.txt	but it 's not enough for a person who is going to live
113.txt	what a wonderful thing for mrs sowerby to think of !
113.txt	what a kind clever woman she must be !
113.txt	how good the buns were !
113.txt	and what delicious fresh milk !
113.txt	magic is in her just as it is in dickon
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	she is a magic person 
113.txt	tell her we are grateful dickon extremely grateful 
113.txt	it makes her think of ways to do things nice things 
113.txt	he enjoyed them 
113.txt	he liked this so much that he improved upon it
113.txt	tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme
113.txt	this was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind
113.txt	they actually awoke to the fact that as mrs sowerby had fourteen people to provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two extra appetites every day 
113.txt	so they asked her to let them send some of their shillings to buy things
113.txt	dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park outside the garden where mary had first found him piping to the wild creatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort of tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it 
113.txt	roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king besides being deliciously satisfying 
113.txt	you could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people
113.txt	every beautiful morning the magic was worked by the mystic circle under the plum tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief blossom time was ended 
113.txt	after the ceremony colin always took his walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly found power at intervals 
113.txt	each day he grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover more ground 
113.txt	and each day his belief in the magic grew stronger as well it might 
113.txt	he tried one experiment after another as he felt himself gaining strength and it was dickon who showed him the best things of all
113.txt	yesterday
113.txt	he said one morning after an absence
113.txt	i went to thwaite for mother an
113.txt	near th
113.txt	blue cow inn i seed bob haworth  he 's the strongest chap on th
113.txt	moor  he 's the champion wrestler an
113.txt	he can jump higher than any other chap an
113.txt	throw th
113.txt	hammer farther  he 's gone all th
113.txt	way to scotland for th
113.txt	sports some years  he 's knowed me ever since i was a little un an
113.txt	he 's a friendly sort an
113.txt	i axed him some questions  th
113.txt	gentry calls him a athlete and i thought o
113.txt	thee mester colin and i says how did tha
113.txt	make tha
113.txt	muscles stick out that way bob ? did tha
113.txt	do anythin
113.txt	extra to make thysel
113.txt	so strong ?
113.txt	an
113.txt	he says well yes lad i did  a strong man in a show that came to thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an
113.txt	legs an
113.txt	every muscle in my body  an
113.txt	i says could a delicate chap make himself stronger with em bob ?
113.txt	an
113.txt	he laughed an
113.txt	says art tha
113.txt	th
113.txt	delicate chap ?
113.txt	an
113.txt	i says no but i knows a young gentleman that 's gettin
113.txt	well of a long illness an
113.txt	i wish i knowed some o
113.txt	them tricks to tell him about
113.txt	i did n't say no names an
113.txt	he did n't ask none  he 's friendly same as i said an
113.txt	he stood up an
113.txt	showed me good natured like an
113.txt	i imitated what he did till i knowed it by heart
113.txt	can you show me ?
113.txt	he cried 
113.txt	will you ?
113.txt	aye to be sure
113.txt	dickon answered getting up 
113.txt	but he says tha
113.txt	mun do em gentle at first an
113.txt	be careful not to tire thysel
113.txt	 rest in between times an
113.txt	take deep breaths an
113.txt	do n't overdo 
113.txt	i 'll be careful
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	show me !
113.txt	dickon you are the most magic boy in the world !
113.txt	show me !
113.txt	colin watched them with widening eyes 
113.txt	he could do a few while he was sitting down
113.txt	presently he did a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied feet 
113.txt	mary began to do them also 
113.txt	soot who was watching the performance became much disturbed and left his branch and hopped about restlessly because he could not do them too
113.txt	from that time the exercises were part of the day 's duties as much as the magic was 
113.txt	it became possible for both colin and mary to do more of them each time they tried and such appetites were the results that but for the basket dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he arrived they would have been lost 
113.txt	but the little oven in the hollow and mrs sowerby 's bounties were so satisfying that mrs medlock and the nurse and dr craven became mystified again 
113.txt	you can trifle with your breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream
113.txt	they are eating next to nothing
113.txt	said the nurse 
113.txt	they 'll die of starvation if they ca n't be persuaded to take some nourishment  and yet see how they look
113.txt	look !
113.txt	exclaimed mrs medlock indignantly 
113.txt	i 'm moithered to death with them 
113.txt	they 're a pair of young satans 
113.txt	bursting their jackets one day and the next turning up their noses at the best meals cook can tempt them with 
113.txt	not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce did they set a fork into yesterday and the poor woman fair invented a pudding for them and back it 's sent 
113.txt	she almost cried
113.txt	she 's afraid she 'll be blamed if they starve themselves into their graves
113.txt	craven came and looked at colin long and carefully he wore an extremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showed him the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to look at but it was even more worried when he sat down by colin 's sofa and examined him 
113.txt	he had been called to london on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks 
113.txt	when young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly 
113.txt	the waxen tinge had left colins skin and a warm rose showed through it
113.txt	his beautiful eyes were clear and the hollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out 
113.txt	his once dark heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from his forehead and were soft and warm with life 
113.txt	his lips were fuller and of a normal color 
113.txt	in fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight 
113.txt	dr craven held his chin in his hand and thought him over
113.txt	i am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	you will lose all you have gained and you have gained amazingly 
113.txt	you ate so well a short time ago 
113.txt	that will not do 
113.txt	i told you it was an unnatural appetite
113.txt	mary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly made a very queer sound which she tried so violently to repress that she ended by almost choking
113.txt	what is the matter ?
113.txt	said dr craven turning to look at her
113.txt	mary became quite severe in her manner
113.txt	it was something between a sneeze and a cough
113.txt	she replied with reproachful dignity
113.txt	and it got into my throat 
113.txt	but
113.txt	she said afterward to colin
113.txt	it just burst out because all at once i could n't help remembering that last big potato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through that thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it 
113.txt	i could n't stop myself 
113.txt	is there any way in which those children can get food secretly ?
113.txt	dr
113.txt	craven inquired of mrs medlock
113.txt	there 's no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the trees
113.txt	mrs medlock answered 
113.txt	and if they want anything different to eat from what 's sent up to them they need only ask for it 
113.txt	they stay out in the grounds all day and see no one but each other 
113.txt	well
113.txt	said dr craven
113.txt	the boy is a new creature 
113.txt	so long as going without food agrees with them we need not disturb ourselves 
113.txt	so is the girl
113.txt	said mrs medlock 
113.txt	her hair 's grown thick and healthy looking and she 's got a bright color
113.txt	the glummest ill natured little thing she used to be and now her and master colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones 
113.txt	perhaps they 're growing fat on that 
113.txt	perhaps they are
113.txt	said dr craven 
113.txt	let them laugh 
113.txt	in the robin 's nest there were eggs and the robin 's mate sat upon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and careful wings 
113.txt	at first she was very nervous and the robin himself was indignantly watchful 
113.txt	even dickon did not go near the close grown corner in those days but waited until by the quiet working of some mysterious spell he seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little pair that in the garden there was nothing which was not quite like themselves nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what was happening to them the immense tender terrible heart breaking beauty and solemnity of eggs 
113.txt	if there had been one person in that garden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that if an egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and crash through space and come to an end if there had been even one who did not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness even in that golden springtime air 
113.txt	but they all knew it and felt it and the robin and his mate knew they knew it
113.txt	at first the robin watched mary and colin with sharp anxiety 
113.txt	for some mysterious reason he knew he need not watch dickon 
113.txt	the first moment he set his dew bright black eye on dickon he knew he was not a stranger but a sort of robin without beak or feathers 
113.txt	he could speak robin which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other
113.txt	to speak robin to a robin is like speaking french to a frenchman
113.txt	dickon always spoke it to the robin himself so the queer gibberish he used when he spoke to humans did not matter in the least 
113.txt	the robin thought he spoke this gibberish to them because they were not intelligent enough to understand feathered speech 
113.txt	his movements also were robin 
113.txt	they never startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or threatening 
113.txt	any robin could understand dickon so his presence was not even disturbing
113.txt	but at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other two 
113.txt	in the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden on his legs 
113.txt	he was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of wild animals were thrown over him 
113.txt	that in itself was doubtful 
113.txt	then when he began to stand up and move about he did it in a queer unaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to help him 
113.txt	the robin used to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously his head tilted first on one side and then on the other 
113.txt	he thought that the slow movements might mean that he was preparing to pounce as cats do
113.txt	when cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very slowly 
113.txt	the robin talked this over with his mate a great deal for a few days but after that he decided not to speak of the subject because her terror was so great that he was afraid it might be injurious to the eggs
113.txt	when the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it was an immense relief 
113.txt	but for a long time or it seemed a long time to the robin he was a source of some anxiety 
113.txt	he did not act as the other humans did 
113.txt	he seemed very fond of walking but he had a way of sitting or lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner to begin again
113.txt	one day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to learn to fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing 
113.txt	he had taken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to rest 
113.txt	so it occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly or rather to walk 
113.txt	he mentioned this to his mate and when he told her that the eggs would probably conduct themselves in the same way after they were fledged she was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested and derived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of her nest though she always thought that the eggs would be much cleverer and learn more quickly 
113.txt	but then she said indulgently that humans were always more clumsy and slow than eggs and most of them never seemed really to learn to fly at all 
113.txt	you never met them in the air or on tree tops
113.txt	after a while the boy began to move about as the others did but all three of the children at times did unusual things 
113.txt	they would stand under the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way which was neither walking nor running nor sitting down 
113.txt	they went through these movements at intervals every day and the robin was never able to explain to his mate what they were doing or tying to do 
113.txt	he could only say that he was sure that the eggs would never flap about in such a manner
113.txt	but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was doing the thing with them birds could be quite sure that the actions were not of a dangerous nature 
113.txt	of course neither the robin nor his mate had ever heard of the champion wrestler bob haworth and his exercises for making the muscles stand out like lumps 
113.txt	robins are not like human beings
113.txt	their muscles are always exercised from the first and so they develop themselves in a natural manner 
113.txt	if you have to fly about to find every meal you eat your muscles do not become atrophied atrophied means wasted away through want of use
113.txt	when the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like the others the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace and content 
113.txt	fears for the eggs became things of the past 
113.txt	knowing that your eggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the fact that you could watch so many curious things going on made setting a most entertaining occupation 
113.txt	on wet days the eggs
113.txt	but even on wet days it could not be said that mary and colin were dull 
113.txt	one morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and colin was beginning to feel a little restive as he was obliged to remain on his sofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about mary had an inspiration
113.txt	now that i am a real boy
113.txt	colin had said
113.txt	they want to be doing things all the time 
113.txt	do you know that when i waken in the morning mary when it 's quite early and the birds are just shouting outside and everything seems just shouting for joy even the trees and things we ca n't really hear i feel as if i must jump out of bed and shout myself 
113.txt	if i did it just think what would happen !
113.txt	my legs and arms and all my body are so full of magic that i ca n't keep them still
113.txt	the nurse would come running and mrs medlock would come running and they would be sure you had gone crazy and they 'd send for the doctor
113.txt	colin giggled himself 
113.txt	he could see how they would all look how horrified by his outbreak and how amazed to see him standing upright
113.txt	i wish my father would come home
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i 'm always thinking about it but we could n't go on like this much longer 
113.txt	i ca n't stand lying still and pretending and besides i look too different 
113.txt	i wish it was n't raining today 
113.txt	i want to tell him myself
113.txt	colin
113.txt	she began mysteriously
113.txt	do you know how many rooms there are in this house ?
113.txt	about a thousand i suppose
113.txt	there 's about a hundred no one ever goes into
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	no one ever knew though mrs medlock nearly found me out 
113.txt	i lost my way when i was coming back and i stopped at the end of your corridor 
113.txt	that was the second time i heard you crying 
113.txt	and one rainy day i went and looked into ever so many of them
113.txt	a hundred rooms no one goes into
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	suppose we go and look at them 
113.txt	wheel me in my chair and nobody would know we went 
113.txt	it sounds almost like a secret garden 
113.txt	that 's what i was thinking
113.txt	said mary 
113.txt	there are galleries where you could run 
113.txt	we could do our exercises
113.txt	there is a little indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory elephants 
113.txt	there are all sorts of rooms 
113.txt	ring the bell
113.txt	when the nurse came in he gave his orders
113.txt	i want my chair
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	john can push me as far as the picture gallery because there are some stairs 
113.txt	then he must go away and leave us alone until i send for him again 
113.txt	miss mary and i are going to look at the part of the house which is not used 
113.txt	when the footman had wheeled the chair into the picture gallery and left the two together in obedience to orders colin and mary looked at each other delighted 
113.txt	as soon as mary had made sure that john was really on his way back to his own quarters below stairs colin got out of his chair
113.txt	i am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other
113.txt	he said
113.txt	and then i am going to jump and then we will do bob haworth 's exercises 
113.txt	they looked at the portraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and holding the parrot on her finger
113.txt	all these
113.txt	said colin
113.txt	they lived a long time ago 
113.txt	that parrot one i believe is one of my great great great great aunts 
113.txt	she looks rather like you mary not as you look now but as you looked when you came here 
113.txt	now you are a great deal fatter and better looking 
113.txt	must be my relations 
113.txt	so are you
113.txt	they went to the indian room and amused themselves with the ivory elephants 
113.txt	they found the rose colored brocade boudoir and the hole in the cushion the mouse had left but the mice had grown up and run away and the hole was empty 
113.txt	they saw more rooms and made more discoveries than mary had made on her first pilgrimage 
113.txt	they found new corridors and corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked and weird old things they did not know the use of 
113.txt	it was a curiously entertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the same house with other people but at the same time feeling as if one were miles away from them was a fascinating thing
113.txt	i 'm glad we came
113.txt	colin said 
113.txt	i like it 
113.txt	we will ramble about every rainy day 
113.txt	we shall always be finding new queer corners and things 
113.txt	i never knew i lived in such a big queer old place
113.txt	when the nurse carried the tray downstairs she slapped it down on the kitchen dresser so that mrs loomis the cook could see the highly polished dishes and plates
113.txt	look at that !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	this is a house of mystery and those two children are the greatest mysteries in it 
113.txt	if they keep that up every day
113.txt	said the strong young footman john
113.txt	i should have to give up my place in time for fear of doing my muscles an injury 
113.txt	there 'd be small wonder that he weighs twice as much today as he did a month ago 
113.txt	she had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because she thought the change might have been made by chance 
113.txt	she said nothing today but she sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel
113.txt	she could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside 
113.txt	that was the change she noticed
113.txt	i know what you want me to tell you
113.txt	said colin after she had stared a few minutes
113.txt	you are wondering why the curtain is drawn back 
113.txt	i am going to keep it like that
113.txt	why ?
113.txt	asked mary
113.txt	i wakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the magic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that i could n't lie still 
113.txt	i got up and looked out of the window 
113.txt	the room was quite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and somehow that made me go and pull the cord 
113.txt	she looked right down at me as if she were laughing because she was glad i was standing there 
113.txt	it made me like to look at her 
113.txt	i want to see her laughing like that all the time 
113.txt	i think she must have been a sort of magic person perhaps 
113.txt	because it does n't make me angry any more to see her laughing 
113.txt	you are so like her now
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	that sometimes i think perhaps you are her ghost made into a boy 
113.txt	he thought it over and then answered her slowly
113.txt	if i were her ghost my father would be fond of me
113.txt	do you want him to be fond of you ?
113.txt	inquired mary
113.txt	if he grew fond of me i think i should tell him about the magic 
113.txt	it might make him more cheerful 
113.txt	i used to hate it because he was not fond of me 
113.txt	chapter xxvi
113.txt	it 's mother !
113.txt	after the morning 's incantations colin sometimes gave them magic lectures
113.txt	i like to do it
113.txt	he explained
113.txt	i can only give short lectures now because i am very young and besides ben weatherstaff would feel as if he were in church and he would go to sleep 
113.txt	because when i grow up and make great scientific discoveries i shall be obliged to lecture about them and so this is practise 
113.txt	th
113.txt	best thing about lecturin
113.txt	said ben
113.txt	is that a chap can get up an
113.txt	say aught he pleases an
113.txt	no other chap can answer him back  i would n't be agen
113.txt	lecturin
113.txt	a bit mysel
113.txt	sometimes 
113.txt	he looked him over with critical affection
113.txt	it was not so much the lecture which interested him as the legs which looked straighter and stronger each day the boyish head which held itself up so well the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which had filled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light he remembered in another pair 
113.txt	sometimes when colin felt ben 's earnest gaze meant that he was much impressed he wondered what he was reflecting on and once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned him
113.txt	what are you thinking about ben weatherstaff ?
113.txt	he asked
113.txt	i was thinkin
113.txt	answered ben
113.txt	as i 'd warrant tha 's gone up three or four pound this week  i was lookin
113.txt	at tha
113.txt	calves an
113.txt	tha
113.txt	i 'd like to get thee on a pair o
113.txt	scales 
113.txt	it 's the magic and and mrs sowerby 's buns and milk and things
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	you see the scientific experiment has succeeded 
113.txt	when he came he was ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling than usual 
113.txt	as they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they fell to work 
113.txt	they always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain 
113.txt	the moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for the weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold 
113.txt	colin was as good at weeding as anyone in these days and he could lecture while he was doing it
113.txt	the magic works best when you work yourself
113.txt	i am going to read books about bones and muscles but i am going to write a book about magic 
113.txt	i am making it up now 
113.txt	i keep finding out things 
113.txt	you can feel it in your bones and muscles 
113.txt	he had been silent for several minutes and they had seen that he was thinking out lectures as he often did
113.txt	when he dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to mary and dickon as if a sudden strong thought had made him do it 
113.txt	he stretched himself out to his tallest height and he threw out his arms exultantly
113.txt	color glowed in his face and his strange eyes widened with joyfulness
113.txt	all at once he had realized something to the full
113.txt	mary ! dickon !
113.txt	he cried 
113.txt	just look at me !
113.txt	do you remember that first morning you brought me in here ?
113.txt	he demanded
113.txt	dickon was looking at him very hard 
113.txt	being an animal charmer he could see more things than most people could and many of them were things he never talked about 
113.txt	he saw some of them now in this boy
113.txt	aye that we do
113.txt	mary looked hard too but she said nothing
113.txt	just this minute
113.txt	said colin
113.txt	and it is real !
113.txt	all at once i remembered it myself when i looked at my hand digging with the trowel and i had to stand up on my feet to see if it was real  i 'm well i 'm well !
113.txt	aye that th
113.txt	art !
113.txt	said dickon
113.txt	i 'm well ! i 'm well !
113.txt	said colin again and his face went quite red all over
113.txt	he had known it before in a way he had hoped it and felt it and thought about it but just at that minute something had rushed all through him a sort of rapturous belief and realization and it had been so strong that he could not help calling out
113.txt	i shall live forever and ever and ever !
113.txt	he cried grandly 
113.txt	i shall find out about people and creatures and everything that grows like dickon and i shall never stop making magic 
113.txt	i 'm well !
113.txt	i 'm well !
113.txt	i feel i feel as if i want to shout out something something thankful joyful !
113.txt	i shall find out thousands and thousands of things
113.txt	tha
113.txt	might sing th
113.txt	doxology
113.txt	he had no opinion of the doxology and he did not make the suggestion with any particular reverence
113.txt	but colin was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing about the doxology
113.txt	what is that ?
113.txt	he inquired
113.txt	dickon can sing it for thee i 'll warrant
113.txt	dickon answered with his all perceiving animal charmer 's smile
113.txt	they sing it i
113.txt	church
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	mother says she believes th
113.txt	skylarks sings it when they gets up i
113.txt	th
113.txt	mornin
113.txt	
113.txt	if she says that it must be a nice song
113.txt	colin answered 
113.txt	i was always too ill 
113.txt	sing it dickon 
113.txt	i want to hear it 
113.txt	i 've never been in a church myself 
113.txt	he understood what colin felt better than colin did himself 
113.txt	he understood by a sort of instinct so natural that he did not know it was understanding 
113.txt	he pulled off his cap and looked round still smiling
113.txt	tha
113.txt	must take off tha
113.txt	cap
113.txt	he said to colin
113.txt	an
113.txt	so mun tha
113.txt	ben an
113.txt	tha
113.txt	mun stand up tha
113.txt	knows 
113.txt	ben weatherstaff scrambled up from his knees and bared his head too with a sort of puzzled half resentful look on his old face as if he did n't know exactly why he was doing this remarkable thing
113.txt	dickon stood out among the trees and rose bushes and began to sing in quite a simple matter of fact way and in a nice strong boy voice
113.txt	amen 
113.txt	colin 's face was thoughtful and appreciative
113.txt	it is a very nice song
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	perhaps it means just what i mean when i want to shout out that i am thankful to the magic 
113.txt	i like it 
113.txt	he stopped and thought in a puzzled way 
113.txt	how can we know the exact names of everything ?
113.txt	sing it again dickon 
113.txt	let us try mary 
113.txt	i want to sing it too 
113.txt	it 's my song
113.txt	how does it begin ?
113.txt	praise god from whom all blessings flow
113.txt	?
113.txt	and they sang it again and mary and colin lifted their voices as musically as they could and dickon 's swelled quite loud and beautiful and at the second line ben weatherstaff raspingly cleared his throat and at the third line he joined in with such vigor that it seemed almost savage and when the
113.txt	amen
113.txt	i never seed no sense in th
113.txt	doxology afore
113.txt	he said hoarsely
113.txt	but i may change my mind i
113.txt	i should say tha 'd gone up five pound this week mester colin five on em !
113.txt	time
113.txt	who is coming in here ?
113.txt	he said quickly 
113.txt	who is it ?
113.txt	she had come in with the last line of their song and she had stood still listening and looking at them 
113.txt	with the ivy behind her the sunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak and her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was rather like a softly colored illustration in one of colin 's books 
113.txt	the door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had entered  she had wonderful affectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in all of them even ben weatherstaff and the
113.txt	creatures
113.txt	unexpectedly as she had appeared not one of them felt that she was an intruder at all 
113.txt	dickon 's eyes lighted like lamps
113.txt	it 's mother that 's who it is !
113.txt	he cried and went across the grass at a run
113.txt	colin began to move toward her too and mary went with him 
113.txt	they both felt their pulses beat faster
113.txt	it 's mother !
113.txt	dickon said again when they met halfway 
113.txt	i knowed tha
113.txt	wanted to see her an
113.txt	i told her where th
113.txt	door was hid
113.txt	even when i was ill i wanted to see you
113.txt	he said
113.txt	i 'd never wanted to see anyone or anything before 
113.txt	you and dickon and the secret garden 
113.txt	she flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed to sweep over her eyes
113.txt	eh ! dear lad !
113.txt	she broke out tremulously 
113.txt	eh ! dear lad !
113.txt	as if she had not known she were going to say it 
113.txt	she did not say
113.txt	mester colin
113.txt	but just
113.txt	dear lad
113.txt	she might have said it to dickon in the same way if she had seen something in his face which touched her 
113.txt	colin liked it
113.txt	are you surprised because i am so well ?
113.txt	he asked
113.txt	she put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her eyes
113.txt	aye that i am !
113.txt	she said
113.txt	but thart so like thy mother tha
113.txt	made my heart jump 
113.txt	do you think
113.txt	said colin a little awkwardly
113.txt	that will make my father like me ?
113.txt	aye for sure dear lad
113.txt	she answered and she gave his shoulder a soft quick pat 
113.txt	he mun come home he mun come home 
113.txt	susan sowerby
113.txt	said ben weatherstaff getting close to her 
113.txt	look at th
113.txt	lad 's legs wilt tha
113.txt	? they was like drumsticks i
113.txt	stockin

113.txt	same time
113.txt	they 're goin

113.txt	she said 
113.txt	let him go on playin

113.txt	she said 
113.txt	i 'll warrant thart like thy mother too 
113.txt	our martha told me as mrs medlock heard she was a pretty woman 
113.txt	thart grown near as hearty as our lisabeth ellen  thalt be like a blush rose when tha
113.txt	grows up my little lass bless thee 
113.txt	she did not mention that when martha came home on her
113.txt	day out
113.txt	and described the plain sallow child she had said that she had no confidence whatever in what mrs medlock had heard 
113.txt	it does n't stand to reason that a pretty woman could be th
113.txt	mother o
113.txt	such a fou
113.txt	little lass
113.txt	mary had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face 
113.txt	she had only known that she looked
113.txt	different
113.txt	but remembering her pleasure in looking at the mem sahib in the past she was glad to hear that she might some day look like her
113.txt	susan sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the whole story of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive 
113.txt	colin walked on one side of her and mary on the other 
113.txt	each of them kept looking up at her comfortable rosy face secretly curious about the delightful feeling she gave them a sort of warm supported feeling 
113.txt	it seemed as if she understood them as dickon understood his
113.txt	creatures 
113.txt	soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew upon her shoulder as if it were dickon 's 
113.txt	when they told her about the robin and the first flight of the young ones she laughed a motherly little mellow laugh in her throat
113.txt	i suppose learnin
113.txt	em to fly is like learnin
113.txt	children to walk but i 'm feared i should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead o
113.txt	legs
113.txt	it was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in her nice moorland cottage way that at last she was told about the magic
113.txt	do you believe in magic ?
113.txt	asked colin after he had explained about indian fakirs 
113.txt	i do hope you do 
113.txt	that i do lad
113.txt	she answered 
113.txt	i never knowed it by that name but what does th

113.txt	said colin opening his beautiful strange eyes at her 
113.txt	suddenly i felt how different i was how strong my arms and legs were you know and how i could dig and stand and i jumped up and wanted to shout out something to anything that would listen 
113.txt	th
113.txt	magic listened when tha

113.txt	listened to anything tha 'd sung  it was th
113.txt	eh !
113.txt	joy that mattered  lad lad what 's names to th
113.txt	joy maker
113.txt	she had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning and when the hungry hour came and dickon brought it out from its hiding place she sat down with them under their tree and watched them devour their food laughing and quite gloating over their appetites 
113.txt	she was full of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things 
113.txt	she told them stories in broad yorkshire and taught them new words 
113.txt	she laughed as if she could not help it when they told her of the increasing difficulty there was in pretending that colin was still a fretful invalid
113.txt	you see we ca n't help laughing nearly all the time when we are together
113.txt	explained colin 
113.txt	we try to choke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever 
113.txt	and it does n't sound ill at all 
113.txt	there 's one thing that comes into my mind so often
113.txt	said mary
113.txt	i keep thinking suppose colin 's face should get to look like a full moon 
113.txt	it is n't like one yet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every day and suppose some morning it should look like one what should we do !
113.txt	and i can scarcely ever hold in when i think of it suddenly 
113.txt	bless us all i can see tha
113.txt	has a good bit o
113.txt	play actin
113.txt	to do
113.txt	said susan sowerby 
113.txt	but tha
113.txt	mester craven 'll come home 
113.txt	do you think he will ?
113.txt	asked colin 
113.txt	why ?
113.txt	i suppose it ud nigh break thy heart if he found out before tha
113.txt	told him in tha
113.txt	own way
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	tha 's laid awake nights plannin
113.txt	it 
113.txt	i could n't bear anyone else to tell him
113.txt	said colin 
113.txt	i think about different ways every day i think now i just want to run into his room 
113.txt	that 'd be a fine start for him
113.txt	said susan sowerby 
113.txt	i would that !
113.txt	he mun come back that he mun 
113.txt	i 'd like to see his face lad 
113.txt	they planned it all 
113.txt	they were to drive over the moor and lunch out of doors among the heather 
113.txt	they would see all the twelve children and dickon 's garden and would not come back until they were tired
113.txt	susan sowerby got up at last to return to the house and mrs medlock
113.txt	it was time for colin to be wheeled back also 
113.txt	but before he got into his chair he stood quite close to susan and fixed his eyes on her with a kind of bewildered adoration and he suddenly caught hold of the fold of her blue cloak and held it fast
113.txt	you are just what i what i wanted
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i wish you were my mother as well as dickon 's !
113.txt	the quick mist swept over her eyes
113.txt	eh ! dear lad !
113.txt	she said 
113.txt	thy own mother 's in this ere very garden i do believe  she couldna
113.txt	thy father mun come back to thee he mun !
113.txt	keep out of it 
113.txt	in the last century more amazing things were found out than in any century before 
113.txt	in this new century hundreds of things still more astounding will be brought to light 
113.txt	at first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done then they begin to hope it can be done then they see it can be done then it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago 
113.txt	one of the new things people began to find out in the last century was that thoughts just mere thoughts are as powerful as electric batteries as good for one as sunlight is or as bad for one as poison 
113.txt	to let a sad thought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germ get into your body 
113.txt	if you let it stay there after it has got in you may never get over it as long as you live
113.txt	so long as mistress mary 's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to be pleased by or interested in anything she was a yellow faced sickly bored and wretched child 
113.txt	circumstances however were very kind to her though she was not at all aware of it 
113.txt	they began to push her about for her own good 
113.txt	when her mind gradually filled itself with robins and moorland cottages crowded with children with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little yorkshire housemaids with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by day and also with a moor boy and his
113.txt	creatures
113.txt	so long as colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his fears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and reflected hourly on humps and early death he was a hysterical half crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and the spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand upon his feet if he tried to do it 
113.txt	when new beautiful thoughts began to push out the old hideous ones life began to come back to him his blood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like a flood 
113.txt	his scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and there was nothing weird about it at all 
113.txt	much more surprising things can happen to anyone who when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one 
113.txt	two things can not be in one place
113.txt	where you tend a rose my lad a thistle can not grow 
113.txt	he had not been courageous
113.txt	he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the dark ones 
113.txt	he had wandered by blue lakes and thought them
113.txt	he had lain on mountain sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him and flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought them 
113.txt	a terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and he had let his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through 
113.txt	he had forgotten and deserted his home and his duties 
113.txt	when he traveled about darkness so brooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong done to other people because it was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom 
113.txt	most strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime on his soul 
113.txt	while the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming alive with it there was a man wandering about certain far away beautiful places in the norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains of switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind filled with dark and heart broken thinking  he was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel registers was
113.txt	archibald craven misselthwaite manor yorkshire england 
113.txt	he had traveled far and wide since the day he saw mistress mary in his study and told her she might have her
113.txt	bit of earth
113.txt	he had been in the most beautiful places in europe though he had remained nowhere more than a few days 
113.txt	he had chosen the quietest and remotest spots 
113.txt	he had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them with such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born
113.txt	but the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he realized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had happened 
113.txt	he was in a wonderful valley in the austrian tyrol and he had been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted any man 's soul out of shadow 
113.txt	he had walked a long way and it had not lifted his
113.txt	but at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream 
113.txt	it was a clear little stream which ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness 
113.txt	sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as it bubbled over and round stones 
113.txt	he saw birds come and dip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away 
113.txt	it seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper
113.txt	the valley was very very still
113.txt	as he sat gazing into the clear running of the water archibald craven gradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet as quiet as the valley itself 
113.txt	he wondered if he were going to sleep but he was not
113.txt	he sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things growing at its edge 
113.txt	there was one lovely mass of blue forget me nots growing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he found himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things years ago 
113.txt	he was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were 
113.txt	he did not know that just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind filling and filling it until other things were softly pushed aside 
113.txt	it was as if a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away 
113.txt	but of course he did not think of this himself 
113.txt	he only knew that the valley seemed to grow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness 
113.txt	he did not know how long he sat there or what was happening to him but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he got up slowly and stood on the moss carpet drawing a long deep soft breath and wondering at himself 
113.txt	something seemed to have been unbound and released in him very quietly
113.txt	what is it ?
113.txt	he said almost in a whisper and he passed his hand over his forehead 
113.txt	i almost feel as if i were alive !
113.txt	neither does anyone else yet 
113.txt	i do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to be able to explain how this had happened to him  he did not understand at all himself but he remembered this strange hour months afterward when he was at misselthwaite again and he found out quite by accident that on this very day colin had cried out as he went into the secret garden
113.txt	i am going to live forever and ever and ever !
113.txt	he did not know that it could be kept 
113.txt	by the next night he had opened the doors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing back 
113.txt	he left the valley and went on his wandering way again 
113.txt	but strange as it seemed to him there were minutes sometimes half hours when without his knowing why the black burden seemed to lift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one
113.txt	slowly slowly for no reason that he knew of he was
113.txt	coming alive
113.txt	as the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the lake of como 
113.txt	there he found the loveliness of a dream 
113.txt	he spent his days upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the soft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so that he might sleep 
113.txt	but by this time he had begun to sleep better he knew and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him
113.txt	perhaps
113.txt	he thought
113.txt	my body is growing stronger 
113.txt	he began to think of misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home
113.txt	now and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what he should feel when he went and stood by the carved four posted bed again and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory white face while it slept and the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close shut eyes
113.txt	he shrank from it
113.txt	one marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon was high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver 
113.txt	the stillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not go into the villa he lived in 
113.txt	he walked down to a little bowered terrace at the water 's edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the heavenly scents of the night 
113.txt	he felt the strange calmness stealing over him and it grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep
113.txt	he did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream
113.txt	his dream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming 
113.txt	he remembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought he was 
113.txt	he thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the late roses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he heard a voice calling 
113.txt	it was sweet and clear and happy and far away 
113.txt	it seemed very far but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his very side
113.txt	archie !
113.txt	archie ! archie !
113.txt	it said and then again sweeter and clearer than before
113.txt	archie !
113.txt	archie !
113.txt	it was such a real voice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it
113.txt	lilias ! lilias !
113.txt	he answered 
113.txt	where are you ?
113.txt	lilias !
113.txt	in the garden
113.txt	it came back like a sound from a golden flute 
113.txt	in the garden !
113.txt	but he did not awaken 
113.txt	he slept soundly and sweetly all through the lovely night 
113.txt	when he did awake at last it was brilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him 
113.txt	he was an italian servant and was accustomed as all the servants of the villa were to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign master might do 
113.txt	no one ever knew when he would go out or come in or where he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or lie in the boat on the lake all night 
113.txt	the man held a salver with some letters on it and he waited quietly until mr craven took them 
113.txt	when he had gone away mr craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand and looking at the lake 
113.txt	his strange calm was still upon him and something more a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not happened as he thought as if something had changed 
113.txt	he was remembering the dream the real real dream
113.txt	in the garden !
113.txt	he said wondering at himself 
113.txt	but the door is locked and the key is buried deep 
113.txt	in the garden !
113.txt	it was directed in a plain woman 's hand but it was not a hand he knew 
113.txt	he opened it scarcely thinking of the writer but the first words attracted his attention at once
113.txt	it was about miss mary i spoke 
113.txt	i will make bold to speak again 
113.txt	please sir i would come home if i was you 
113.txt	i think you would be glad to come and if you will excuse me sir i think your lady would ask you to come if she was here
113.txt	your obedient servant susan sowerby
113.txt	craven read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope
113.txt	he kept thinking about the dream
113.txt	i will go back to misselthwaite
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	yes i 'll go at once
113.txt	in a few days he was in yorkshire again and on his long railroad journey he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in all the ten years past 
113.txt	during those years he had only wished to forget him 
113.txt	now though he did not intend to think about him memories of him constantly drifted into his mind 
113.txt	he remembered the black days when he had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother was dead 
113.txt	he had refused to see it and when he had gone to look at it at last it had been such a weak wretched thing that everyone had been sure it would die in a few days 
113.txt	but to the surprise of those who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then everyone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature
113.txt	he had not meant to be a bad father but he had not felt like a father at all 
113.txt	he had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries but he had shrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his own misery 
113.txt	the first time after a year 's absence he returned to misselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and indifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes round them so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had adored he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death 
113.txt	after that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep and all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid with a vicious hysterical half insane temper 
113.txt	he could only be kept from furies dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail
113.txt	all this was not an uplifting thing to recall but as the train whirled him through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was
113.txt	coming alive
113.txt	perhaps i have been all wrong for ten years
113.txt	he said to himself 
113.txt	it may be too late to do anything quite too late
113.txt	what have i been thinking of !
113.txt	of course this was the wrong magic to begin by saying
113.txt	too late
113.txt	even colin could have told him that 
113.txt	but he knew nothing of magic either black or white 
113.txt	this he had yet to learn 
113.txt	he wondered if susan sowerby had taken courage and written to him only because the motherly creature had realized that the boy was much worse was fatally ill 
113.txt	if he had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession of him he would have been more wretched than ever 
113.txt	but the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it 
113.txt	instead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe in better things
113.txt	could it be possible that she sees that i may be able to do him good and control him ?
113.txt	he thought 
113.txt	i will go and see her on my way to misselthwaite 
113.txt	but when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at the cottage seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a group and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him that their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the morning to help a woman who had a new baby 
113.txt	our dickon
113.txt	mr craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round red cheeked faces each one grinning in its own particular way and he awoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot 
113.txt	he smiled at their friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and gave it to
113.txt	our lizabeth ellen
113.txt	if you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for each of you
113.txt	then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind
113.txt	the drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing
113.txt	why did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been sure he could never feel again that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing nearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six hundred years ?
113.txt	how he had driven away from it the last time shuddering to think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four posted bed with the brocaded hangings 
113.txt	was it possible that perhaps he might find him changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his shrinking from him ?
113.txt	how real that dream had been how wonderful and clear the voice which called back to him
113.txt	in the garden in the garden !
113.txt	i will try to find the key
113.txt	he said 
113.txt	i must though i do n't know why 
113.txt	i will try to open the door 
113.txt	he went into the library and sent for mrs medlock 
113.txt	she came to him somewhat excited and curious and flustered
113.txt	how is master colin medlock ?
113.txt	he inquired
113.txt	well sir
113.txt	mrs medlock answered
113.txt	he 's he 's different in a manner of speaking
113.txt	worse ?
113.txt	he suggested
113.txt	mrs medlock really was flushed
113.txt	well you see sir
113.txt	she tried to explain
113.txt	neither dr craven nor the nurse nor me can exactly make him out 
113.txt	why is that ?
113.txt	to tell the truth sir master colin might be better and he might be changing for the worse  his appetite sir is past understanding and his ways
113.txt	has he become more more peculiar ?
113.txt	her master asked knitting his brows anxiously
113.txt	he 's growing very peculiar when you compare him with what he used to be 
113.txt	he used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began to eat something enormous and then he stopped again all at once and the meals were sent back just as they used to be 
113.txt	you never knew sir perhaps that out of doors he never would let himself be taken 
113.txt	the things we 've gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf 
113.txt	he 'd throw himself into such a state that dr 
113.txt	craven said he could n't be responsible for forcing him 
113.txt	well sir just without warning not long after one of his worst tantrums he suddenly insisted on being taken out every day by miss mary and susan sowerby 's boy dickon that could push his chair 
113.txt	he took a fancy to both miss mary and dickon and dickon brought his tame animals and if you 'll credit it sir out of doors he will stay from morning until night 
113.txt	that 's it sir 
113.txt	how does he look ?
113.txt	was the next question
113.txt	he laughs sometimes in a queer way when he 's alone with miss mary 
113.txt	he never used to laugh at all 
113.txt	dr craven is coming to see you at once if you 'll allow him
113.txt	he never was as puzzled in his life 
113.txt	where is master colin now ?
113.txt	mr craven asked
113.txt	in the garden sir  he 's always in the garden though not a human creature is allowed to go near for fear they 'll look at him
113.txt	craven scarcely heard her last words
113.txt	in the garden
113.txt	he said and after he had sent mrs medlock away he stood and repeated it again and again 
113.txt	in the garden !
113.txt	he took his way as mary had done through the door in the shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds 
113.txt	the fountain was playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers
113.txt	he crossed the lawn and turned into the long walk by the ivied walls
113.txt	he did not walk quickly but slowly and his eyes were on the path 
113.txt	he felt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had so long forsaken and he did not know why 
113.txt	as he drew near to it his step became still more slow 
113.txt	he knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick over it but he did not know exactly where it lay that buried key
113.txt	so he stopped and stood still looking about him and almost the moment after he had paused he started and listened asking himself if he were walking in a dream
113.txt	the ivy hung thick over the door the key was buried under the shrubs no human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years and yet inside the garden there were sounds 
113.txt	they were the sounds of running scuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees they were strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices exclamations and smothered joyous cries 
113.txt	it seemed actually like the laughter of young things the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to be heard but who in a moment or so as their excitement mounted would burst forth 
113.txt	what in heaven 's name was he dreaming of what in heaven 's name did he hear ?
113.txt	was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears ?
113.txt	was it that the far clear voice had meant ?
113.txt	and then the moment came the uncontrollable moment when the sounds forgot to hush themselves 
113.txt	the feet ran faster and faster they were nearing the garden door there was quick strong young breathing and a wild outbreak of laughing shouts which could not be contained and the door in the wall was flung wide open the sheet of ivy swinging back and a boy burst through it at full speed and without seeing the outsider dashed almost into his arms
113.txt	mr craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as a result of his unseeing dash against him and when he held him away to look at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath
113.txt	he was a tall boy and a handsome one 
113.txt	he was glowing with life and his running had sent splendid color leaping to his face 
113.txt	he threw the thick hair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe 
113.txt	it was the eyes which made mr craven gasp for breath
113.txt	who what ? who !
113.txt	he stammered
113.txt	this was not what colin had expected this was not what he had planned
113.txt	he had never thought of such a meeting 
113.txt	and yet to come dashing out winning a race perhaps it was even better 
113.txt	he drew himself up to his very tallest 
113.txt	mary who had been running with him and had dashed through the door too believed that he managed to make himself look taller than he had ever looked before inches taller
113.txt	father
113.txt	he said
113.txt	you ca n't believe it 
113.txt	i scarcely can myself 
113.txt	i 'm colin 
113.txt	i 'm colin 
113.txt	like mrs medlock he did not understand what his father meant when he said hurriedly
113.txt	in the garden !
113.txt	in the garden !
113.txt	yes
113.txt	hurried on colin 
113.txt	no one knows 
113.txt	we kept it to tell you when you came 
113.txt	i 'm well i can beat mary in a race 
113.txt	i 'm going to be an athlete 
113.txt	it was the garden that did it and mary and dickon and the creatures and the magic
113.txt	colin put out his hand and laid it on his father 's arm
113.txt	are n't you glad father ?
113.txt	he ended 
113.txt	are n't you glad ? i 'm going to live forever and ever and ever !
113.txt	craven put his hands on both the boy 's shoulders and held him still 
113.txt	he knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment
113.txt	take me into the garden my boy
113.txt	he said at last 
113.txt	and tell me all about it
